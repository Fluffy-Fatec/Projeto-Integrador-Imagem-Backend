13,The morning crew seems fast and efficient. Night crew is a whole different experience, lines down the street, hour long waits. If this was a one time occurrence it wouldn't be so bad but this is a nightly problem. Beyond this the staff is so highly rude you leave wanting to crash your car through the building. Don't forget they will mistake your order almost every single time as well and serve it to you cold.,1,0,30.4607176,-97.7928744,Austin,United States,30.4607176 -97.7928744,tb_burgerking,2024-06-17 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

22,Meh.. just meh. When I finally get the correct order, it is generally tasty. I'm a picky eater, and have found ways to navigate the menu to get items I like. Worked in the service industry for years as a server, bartender, and trainer. Taking and fulfilling orders is NOT hard, tedious at times though. I only go here when I see they are not busy, in hope that my order is correct when I go to leave. In the 10 times that I have been here in the past past year, I have only had 1 order that was perfectly correct. Just ONE, not an exaggeration. That one order was just 2 large fries and nothing else. Though I will mention that when I got home and pulled them out of the bag, they were hardly what you'd call filled, (nor did I enjoy any on the 3 minute drive home) so little so that I even sent a picture and post to McDonald's on Facebook, at least the few were hot. The evening staff is very pleasant, but the morning staff leaves a lot to be desired, as well as thinking that they can talk negatively about people in Spanish out in the open which, being a light skinned Puerto Rican, I understand perfectly. I have submitted several complaints and NEVER received a call or email back. I just don't go here anymore to avoid the stress of paying money for something that is most likely wrong.,1,0,30.4607176,-97.7928744,Austin,United States,30.4607176 -97.7928744,tb_burgerking,2024-08-17 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

32,This location is wack.
They will literally stop taking orders and make people sit in the parking lot for like 12 minutes until 3:00 a.m. so that they don't get to order dinner food anymore.
We have gone multiple times right after leaving the pinballz arcade just to sit in the parking lot in the Drive-Thru line waiting while they do nothing but wait for the order menu to change over.

50,Normally this location does pretty good, but last night was absolutely ridiculous. I sat in the drive thru for almost an hour waiting to get my order taken, the line was wrapped almost TWICE around the building, and finally I gave up and tried driving up to the window to give them my order since i was next in line. When i got to the window, they told me they couldn't take it and I'd have to go back around. I told them I'd like to put in my order here since I've been waiting all this time, and they proceeded to still refuse and that it's my fault for waiting in the second lane that they claimed was closed and had a sign out. The second lane was open, and the "sign" they were talking about was a wet floor sign they had placed right next to the drive-thru menu. I told them the lane looked open from our side and they still proceeded to argue with me, and then slammed the drive thru window shut. I've never received such deplorable customer service in my life, and if any managers are reading this, I highly suggest firing the two workers from last night.,1,0,30.4607176,-97.7928744,Austin,United States,30.4607176 -97.7928744,tb_burgerking,2025-01-10 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

I have had to go in twice to see why I am still sitting after five minutes. They are new. I understand training new people. But when you place an order and they repeat it back correctly and it comes out wrong or you have to repeat 3 times to make sure they get it right. Someone inside needs to make sure they are reading the whole ticket. Not just a quarter pounder. Especially with the multi menu choice of adding bacon or lettuce and tomatoes.

107,Your general fast food place with subpar service. Went here one morning to get a quick breakfast because we had no time for our usual Saturday morning spot. We ordered several different breakfast items and at the end my wife went to order a single order of three pancakes and sausage breakfast for one of the kids. At checkout it seemed expensive at first, the cashier never repeated the order back to us. When we received our order, we figured out why.

879,This is our hometown MCdonalds and between the wife, grandchildren and I we are here twice a week.  Like review I did on the Hamlin MCDonalds, I call this the older style and it's been [ainted over the years and they removed the small playyard it had.  People now are a afraid of ballpits and it was outside so it didn't get used over 6 months of the year.

There is ample seating, but I've seen more with more seating, but we've never been without finding a seat.  Everything is pretty clean and in good order. Walk-in orders are accurate and fast.  Drive in is fast and about 8 times out of 10 they will have it exact.  Some times they get it wrong, but like we say nobody's perfect.

Since it's right on Rt209 it's easy to get in and out of unless your traveling South on 209 then sometimes it's hard to pull out because there's KFC and Subway and an Ice Cream shop across the street so it's a busy little area in Brodheadsville.

884,Wind Gap, PA location was surprisingly better during COVID 19 because with the interior closed, the drive up was fast and serving fresh food.
The streamlined way allows  serving just the drive up and so, the kitchen staff cooks food for just one area. Probably saves on staff hours.

888,My son and I come to this McDonald's about once a month. It's usually pretty clean here, with the exception of a dirty table now and then. That just means they didn't get out there yet! On this trip...our food was great, but there was this little chubby kid who was left st the table with his 2 way young siblings. He was loud and walking the baby and stressing me out! I have him the EVIL EYE!! Hahahaha anyway the food is always good here, bathrooms have always been pretty clean here too.
It's normally fairly quiet here and lots of high school kids in and out. Chubby kid just enhanced our visit!!,5,2,40.9220806,-75.3999187,Brodheadsville,United States,40.9220806 -75.3999187,tb_burgerking,2024-07-18 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

1831,This location is always running no matter what time or day. The food is always fresh and the service is usually fast. If they ever mess your order up they usually do right by you and give you a fresh new order. This location was renovated recently so everything is brand new. They no longer have the children's play area but it's much more of a sit in restaurant style McDonald's.,5,2,40.7274006,-73.8124604,Queens,United States,40.7274006 -73.8124604,tb_burgerking,2025-04-04 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885
1833,Our visit was on Friday, 5/12/2023. There is a marked improvement in the service and cleanliness at this location on Ft. Hamilton Parkway. Katherine, the Manager, and her staff (Chris) promptly offered help and solutions to my family's needs. The use of a dedicated staff member to continuously clean the dining area was a big plus. I only feel that the beverage station should be closer to the dining area to facilitate the transfer of drinks from station to table; particularly for the disabled.
Another, concern was the price of the food. Though there were "dollar" options available, the price of the more popular sizes and items was very high. A median-income family of four would be wary of dining more than once a month, if that often.
The name of the counter person that helped us during our visit was Chris. He is a credit to the McDonalds company.,4,2,40.7274006,-73.8124604,Queens,United States,40.7274006 -73.8124604,tb_burgerking,2025-01-01 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

1837,Horrible service from the manager. I got 2 cheeseburgers from the drive thru and my bag was leaking with some fluid. Looked inside and both was soaked in oil. The burger was drenched in oil and the wrapper had puddles of oil inside it and once i opened it, it went on my pants and console of my car. Went inside to get another burger but instead the manager tried to justify saying she did it herself and it wasnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t like that and that it just came out. But I tried to explain there was so much oil everywhere that when I tried to pick up the burger it slips right out of my hand and the oil is spilling everywhere. Even when I got a new burger she still insisted on justifying why it was like that instead of apologizing to a customer.

1874,Easy to pick up my mobile orders. They have soda machines so you don't have to worry about specifying no ice in drinks. They include napkins, straw, and lids. Straws have either been paper or plastic. They do not include ketchup packets, so you have to ask counterstaff. $1 drinks is a perk that no other fast food restaurant has. The dining room has plentiful tables and chairs too, ranging from booths to high stools to couch-like chairs. Easy to get there by Q25 or Q34.

1890,There is a major problem with this McDonald's!! I have been coming here for years, and I put up with alot of inconveniences! Non the less, last night was appalling!! What's wrong with the girl cashier tan skin, black hair, the Hispanic or Indian girl with the yellow long press on nails?! Im sure you can single her out of the crowd. I wont say her name even though they all kept saying eachothers names out loud like it was high school musical back there. Is it mandatory for her to not give me my receipt? I , like many other hardworking Americans who have been coming here for as long as we all can remember,  need a receipt; especially just incase how fast food workers forget to give us all of our order.. and wouldn't you know it, not only did they fail to give me my receipt,  but they failed to give me the correct order. I asked for my order more than three times! Is it also part of the owner's of McDonald's policy to berate the customer in Spanish? I'm Puerto Rican and I understand everything they was saying. How rude to have said all of that in front of the customer,  and about the customer.  Is this how you value your rewards members? I'm going to post about my experience on any social media platform! Mark my words! I would also like to state that the woman manager allowed her staff to keep acting maliciously and she acted as if nothing was going wrong. Is this how you run your establishment?!
The African American fellow, tall, with a kind of lisp, gave me again the wrong order and the wrong receipt. Must be nice to pick out the garbage a receipt from three hours ago to give to me, thinking i wouldnt know the difference! The owner should pop on in!! Must Like losing out on money.

After 5 minutes the manager came and said I going to give you $2 more to complete the change.

1963,Me and my wife always love McDonald's especially their fires but this place make me rethinking McDonald's service mindset. I have order there a couple time but they never ever give condiment when ask at the drive thru. I always had to double check and remind them again when picking up the order. What really disappointed me and make me laugh was a month ago I order two Cheeseburger and to my surprise I got bread, pickle, cheese, and ketchup??? There was no beef. Again today, I thought maybe I'll us the mobile app to order for the first time and just maybe just maybe they will get my order right. No surprise and usually I don't write about these little things but when it happen over and over again that irritate me. McDonald really need to improve their service in the US.

1990,The best thing about this McDonald's is the cleanliness compared to most McD restaurants in Queens. The worst thing about it is the staff. They pay no mind to customers waiting in line to have their order taken even when it isn't even busy in the slightest. Sometime they don't give me my receipt. Sometime my order will be ready in the bag, but they'll set it aside, and realize it much later, as I watch them complete other orders wondering why mine is taking too long, and it turns out my order was read all along, they just never bother to call the number.

2042,I almost always use the drive-thru and English is my first language and I'm born in New York City. That being said, numerous times I have been unable to understand the other person in the booth and they cannot understand me. Sometimes it is faulty intercom issues itself. But, often it is someone in the booth who does not understand or speak English properly! This is highly frustrating when I have to repeat my order as much as six times! Yeah, I said six times! Last weekend,  it was an Indian kid  who I could not for the life of me understand! And he could not understand me. A polite enough kid when I reached the booth, but seriously frustrating experience! Other times it's someone who does speak the language properly, or a close facsimile LOL but they are distracted by their phone. When I finally reach the booth to pay, often, and usually female LOL, the cashier is thumbing through her phone. McDonald's needs to set some standards for the people who work the drive thru. If you are face to face with a cashier with language issues, it's easier to deal with, but, Don't put these people on the Drive through intercom! By the way the food is just fine there. No issues on that end. LOL, work it out Mickey d!,3,0,40.7274006,-73.8124604,Queens,United States,40.7274006 -73.8124604,tb_burgerking,2024-11-13 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

3054,Say what you want about McDonald's, but this location has it figured out! I really hate that I forgot to take pictures for you guys, but go here! They have order kiosks and you can have your food brought to you by one of the staff.
Something that doesn't happen often with McDonald's, but this location really was clean. There was a modern aesthetic to it, along with the pastries (never seen at anothr McDonald's).
The food did take a while but considering the wait volume (-20/30) people, I can understand.
Overall, this is a great place for cheap food to go and to stay. If you're not specific about the way you like your food, order at the kiosk (get a table marker) and go on upstairs and find yourself a table.,5,0,40.7505058,-73.990583,New York,United States,40.7505058 -73.990583,tb_burgerking,2024-09-23 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

3058,NEVER GO HERE - HORRIBLE SERVICE. They're always rude!!! Either they're RACIST or just plain rude. I asked for a paper bag 3 times and the two Spanish ladies ignored me despite making eye contact. The one at the pick up counter gave a little nod then walked away even though the paper bags were right next to her!! Then I went to the cashier and she just gave me a blank look and motioned to the pick-up counter without saying a word. Then I told the girl yet again, that I need a paper bag please and she just gave me a dumbfounded look with a twang of annoyance and walked away and then fave out more orders. They were just so rude and every other time I've been there! They were all Spanish and maybe don't like Asians but they're horrible people and I never want to go to this location ever again!!!,1,2,40.7505058,-73.990583,New York,United States,40.7505058 -73.990583,tb_burgerking,2024-07-19 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885
3059,The staff decided that there were no longer any mcflurries, after they prepared 2 sundaes and a milk shake . Suddenly the icecream machine was broken. A Spanish speaking customer after me was then able to order not only a milkshake but3 mcflurries. When I inquired about it I was told that it was now fixed although no one has gone near the machine during the time since I was denied IN ENGLISH. I then stepped outside to get my friends and tell them our food was ready, they took the tray and headed up while I put our other friend in an Uber. When I came back in security who had just been no more then 5 feet from me while I ordered, paid, and received my food, made someone come down to confirm that I was a paying customer. If only the counter staff was as particular as the security guard.
I won't be coming back here again, at least until my Spanish is better,1,2,40.7505058,-73.990583,New York,United States,40.7505058 -73.990583,tb_burgerking,2024-11-29 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

I came into the store and bought my dinner at 9pm.  I sit there for 1 hour and then the staff came to me and asked me to leave. I thought that the store might be closing so I left.

3088,I don't know if I'm like from the 20th century, but this McDonald's is super high-tech. This McDonald consists of three floors. The main floor is what you walk on to, it's the second floor. Most of the seating is on the third floor, I didn't go up to it just because I had an ankle problem and unfortunately the elevator was out. The basement, and area you can't get to it, is where the girl is it so fancy contrapment takes your food from the grill to the second floor where you order. I just thought that was cool while I was waiting around for my food. They have about six self-serving machines that are in front of the restaurant.

4225,The 1st issue with this McDonald's location was at 7pm they don't have sweet tea.  Secondly, the water for a hot tea was luke warm, at best, then when asked, "Is this the hottest this water can get?"  With a response of yes.  This is at 7pm.

4228,This is a 24/7 location, which is great. The receipt printer was broken for a while which was annoying because they would still read off the order numbers as a method of calling people.

4247,This is the worst McDonald's in New York City. The heroin users congregate at the main table in front of the register and they harass customers as they come in. They nod off and just buy a soda or water to occupy the table for hours. There's homeless in front of the McDonald's and to the side and inside there's a lot of shady individuals that are just sitting there coming down off heroin highs.

5258,Pretty decent McDonalds to get decently priced food in the heart of Lower East Side. The interior is super spacious, there are kiosks built into the walls, and the bathroom was super clean. Unfortunately, they closed the second floor for reasons unknown. It was also super busy when I went (Friday Night) so the orders took an extremely long amount of time to prepare (over 15-20 minutes).,3,2,40.7188385,-73.9882797,New York,United States,40.7188385 -73.9882797,tb_burgerking,2024-05-26 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885
5261,Got two Filet-O-Fish sandwiches.  Both were good as expected.  I ordered through the McDonald's app and opted to pickup my sandwiches at the drive thru.  I told the employee at the speaker that I had an app order to pickup and gave her the code.  She instructed me to go to the first window.  There I was given the receipt, thanked, and told to go to the next window.  At the 2nd window I was told to go to a 3rd window to pickup the order.  The 3rd window is kind of funny, since it seems like an afterthought.  Since it is at the corner of the building close to a sign, it is difficult to get close enough to be handed the order without scraping the side of your car. Then to leave you have to turn your wheels hard right.  The employees were very friendly.,4,2,32.8206541,-117.1780115,San Diego,United States,32.8206541 -117.1780115,tb_burgerking,2024-06-09 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885
5262,Ordered on the machine because the workers were too busy talking.  Pay by card at the machine and no receipt comes out.  I tell the worker I didn't get a receipt and he says "don't worry we will bring it out." I dutifully sit down with my table number with my family and wait. I really wanted my receipt, and, as you can imagine, this will be important later.

So we sit around for a while, I go and ask for ketchup, cream, and sugar.  Get like 4 ketchup packs for 4 people's orders.  Ketchup poor I make my way back to my disappointed family and dole out one ketchup each.

More waiting, finally I go up with my table number and ask about the order.  The same worker looks at me and says "do you have a receipt?" My pocket-version of Kafka bursts into flames and I can only laugh at the absurdity.  I finally get the attention of the manager who manages to pull my order from the void of the machine.

Why two stars? Because when the g

The young female supervisor or manager that had to take care of the refund was very rude and unapologetic for their mistake. The worst customer service I've had in that square in years.  Perhaps when they did the remodel they should have gotten rid of the terrible staff as well. Come on McDonald's you can do better than that. Please take some pride and have expectations for your employees serving your public.

5311,McDonalds Balboa. The one next to the gas station. Probably the only McDonalds in area that ignores customers at the front. I literally had to get agressive and ask for a Manager on duty to get some assistance. What really ticked me off was when a guy came in on a wheel chair and we were both patiently waiting for some assistance. Customer service definitely isn't a priority at this location. No "Hi, welcome, we'll be right with you". Nothing. When I told the woman there that they had customers, all I got was a "I know". Unprofessional, unapologetic, and uncaring staff and I think the woman may have been a supervisor/manager. Her shirt was different from the rest.

5823,After exploring Chinatown in lower Manhattan, I decided to walk to the only McDonald's in the immediate area, on the south side of Canal Street. It didn't look like much from the outside, but once I entered I walked up to the counter to order one coffee which took a few minutes since the place was somewhat busy and there was a customer in line in front of me.

I got my order and walked upstairs to the first level and sat at a comfortable booth. Within a few minutes a manager came to my table to ask if everything was OK, and I told him "Yes", but I was having trouble to connect to the free WiFi. He immediately helped me with this and although the connection was slow, I was pleased that the problem was solved.

Then the manager chatted with me and asked if I would mind doing a survey and I filled out the online survey. Then he said I was entitled to a free burger so I had a Big Mac.

I think this is a very well managed place and will definitely return when I am back in Manhattan in the Chinatown area.,4,2,40.7185138,-74.0011677,New York,United States,40.7185138 -74.0011677,tb_burgerking,2024-10-08 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

5873,I don't expect much when I visit a McDonald's, but this location certainly is one of the worst I've visited in the city.

5890,What can I say about a restaurant, that sits in New York City & on the busiest day & receive your burger&fries with steam coming off the items, the security guard keep away the strays.

5892,Visited a couple of times while in the area for civil court and the staff behind the counter are usually great, but the security guy in the lobby or the floor manager or whatever blocked me trying to leave with my drink, telling me the sitting area was upstairs when i was literally just trying to leave. When I sat down here this morning a manager started harassing a customer who was sitting with a cup of coffee, calling him homeless, telling him he had to leave in 10 minutes and causing an argument between the guy and another customer, and just walked away while they yelled at each other.

5912,It's McDonald's. You kinda know what to expect. One thing you should be prepared for if you're not a native of Manhattan, it's very pricy. I guess paying for the N.Y. rent causes the prices to be higher than what we have in Texas. The service was fast and organized, despite being very busy, just don't expect to get your usual meal for your usual price.

5916,So just to clarify I did not actually eat here BUT I am from the south and a huge fan of sweet tea! Also everywhere you go around here water bottles are around $3. We went to this McDonalds in hopes of finding sweet tea in NYC and we were successful! You have to get it from behind the counter but it was good and only $1 for a large just like back home.

5919,The food & service is excellent & if you are taking the food out it's great.

5929,Update: it's so frustrating to eat here! There is a virtual army of panhandlers from the nice guy who opens the door for you to the more aggressive ones that approach you as you order, or eat your food. In addition, the place is still disorganized and dirty.  That's McDonald's in New York.

5953,I am not that pleased with, McD. The ice cream is nice. What I don't like about a lot fast food places; is that the ongoing clean up process is sometimes flat out disgusting.

5962,They renovated their store and it's very nice and modern. They staff is pretty much like all the other fast food chain out there (high school kids working part time), so nothing out of the ordinary. They have free wifi, so you can definitely take advantage of the service and surf the web while enjoying a sweet tea or something. They have the basic dollar menu - sweet tea, apple pies, apple dippers, cone and some other things, but too bad they don't have the chicken sandwich or McDouble for a dollar. The seating area can get packed sometimes and they don't always open the third floor to the public, although it really doesn't fit that many people, but sometimes you would have to wait a while for someone to finish before you can get a table and seat.,3,0,40.7185138,-74.0011677,New York,United States,40.7185138 -74.0011677,tb_burgerking,2024-06-08 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

5966,The burger my husband had was fine however, my chicken sandwich was disgusting. It tasted old and hard. The fries and sweet tea were the same as any other McDonalds, obviously fresh because it sees extremely heavy traffic. The ordering kiosks are super convient but you can't customize -- as in you can't take onions or tomatoes off of your sandwich, and of course no cash payments are accepted unless you go to the actual counter.

The security of this establishment is a rude , non friendly , and a cruel person.

6090,My girlfriend and her friends visited this establishment on 04/16/23 at around 12:50AM. An African American worker in a grey shirt (Male) with braided hair was incredibly racist to her and her friends, using an Asian accent when talking to them. He was originally on the side and took over the register from one of his coworkers on purpose with the intent of being completely racist to them. He spoke with an Asian accent ridiculing their race and telling them he can serve them for an extra $5.00. While this was happening, all of the other employees laughed and egged him on. My girlfriend and her friends felt very unsafe, especially late at night.

Service was fast, quick and extremely efficient. Waiting time was less than 5 minutes. Good fast food spot for a quick bite to eat! They also offer order yourself service and of course on the app too! Food was good. The only reason I couldn't give this McDonald's a 5 stars was because many tables and chairs to eat in were a bit dirty.

6227,It's a McDonald's. If you want you've eaten at one, you've eaten at them all.

However, this review is based solely on the location. 8th Avenue has a SERIOUS homeless problem, and the restaurant is always swarmed with them. If it were just that they were begging for change, I could forgive it. Unfortunately most of the people I've seen are out of their minds on whatever drugs and usually screaming and carrying on. They make me incredibly uneasy, to the point where I'm not comfortable eating here anymore. More than once, I've seen fights break out.

6251,I've been here numerous times and have no complaints about the food or the staff. As mentioned in other reviews here, there is a problem with the overall cleanliness of the restaurant and the "transients" that call the place "home".

I'm not sure if there is a homeless shelter nearby or if people just love to hang out in the place, but there are always less fortunate people there especially in the morning. Just this morning I've witnessed the NYPD escort a woman out of the restaurant that was loitering. There are signs throughout the restaurant that clearly state No Loitering and that there is a 30 min time limit. Now that the weather is getting colder, people are just looking to stay warm.

Unfortunately, McDonalds is in a difficult position. As a former General Manager of a fast food restaurant, I used to deal with "rough" teenagers and "undesirables" especially at night. I wanted my paying customers to have a friendly, warm and inviting environment to eat in with their families. The "rough" crowd made that very difficult to maintain. I, like McDs started with signs. The McDs in this review also has full time security to help keep the people safe and moving.

You see, you just can't stand at the door and not allow people to come into McDs. The best you can do is try to manage it. I give them a lot of credit for trying to do just that. I also give credit to the employees as they have to deal with it all day long. As far as the cleanliness, they can do a much better job there. I can't speak for all the people given Lobby Duty, but I've never seen one with a cleaning bottle and rag to clean the tables. So, even I had to sit at a table this morning that wasn't clean. It wasn't exactly disgusting, but it wasn't clean either.

I've never been in the bathrooms because I try to avoid them at all costs. I've seen the people that come out of there and also the bathrooms at Penn Station down the block. It can't be pleasant in there and frankly, I wouldn't want to clean it either.

There are other McDs in the area, but this one is at times convenient for me. You can't beat the price for breakfast in that area in NYC. I would NEVER bring my family there. But for a quick stop in the morning, it's ok.

So, the 3 stars are just for the environment, the "ambiance" and the cleanliness. The food and the staff are great, it's just a "difficult" place to eat in given the community.,3,2,40.7525294,-73.9928762,New York,United States,40.7525294 -73.9928762,tb_burgerking,2024-11-08 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

I ate it of course but still it tasted bad compared to the original McChicken,1,2,40.7525294,-73.9928762,New York,United States,40.7525294 -73.9928762,tb_burgerking,2025-02-05 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

6308,The meal was good but there were to many homeless people and beggars inside this McDonalds. The beggars where fairly aggressive, impertinent and well prepared for tourists. They wanted to push a brasilian woman next to my table to give them 20 $.  She wanted to give them 5 $, but they tried to argue with her for 15 minutes! It was more like threatening than arguing. I was so pissed of after this experience.... The food is great, but the management should take care about this situation and protect their guests, especially tourists.,1,2,40.7525294,-73.9928762,New York,United States,40.7525294 -73.9928762,tb_burgerking,2025-03-07 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

The security guard was sitting down talking to a customer, I knocked on the door and realized there was no one inside. So I asked him to open the door. He told me that if I did not have attitude he could do it faster. Then he opened the door and said Black people always have attitudes. He proceeded to curse at. I went to talk to the manager who pretty much ignored me and continued cooking French fries. I called the corporate number.

It's 1:30 am on a Saturday and my Lord not 1 but 7 people either sleeping in booths or begging for food or money, and the bath room doors don't even lock. Is this allowed to happen? Is this how we run businesses in NY.  I guess McDonalds cares about ALL of their customers, no matter how unsafe they feel.  They just want their money and can't get sued by someone less fortunate, for being kicked out even if they haven't ordered anything.

6955,Sometimes the closing hours are not reliable! I cant tell you how many times I've had to cancel an uber eats order for delivery because somewhere the order was accepted but this place was closed! Disappointing to the customer who was looking forward to that late night/wee hours of the morning food and infuriating to me because that's MY TIME wasted and money not going into MY pocket! aka not getting paid for delivery!

On a personal note, I've had MANY upon MANY confrontations with the people who give me the food - I ONLY drink REGULAR dr pepper and as an avid soda drinker since elementary school (now 51) I know the difference between regular and diet - it seems like if you come here after a certain hour, even though I've asked for REGULAR DR PEPPER, I always seem to get one that tastes like a diet one! I have had them give me 3 dr peppers in one drive thru order just to end up with something that clearly was NOT a regular one!!! In addition to having the attitudes checked from those that gave me BIG ATTITUDE for being so, I guess "insistent that this was not regular dr pepper, I would also examine the machines when they run low or tell the employees not to outright LIE about giving me regular dr pepper just to keep $1.40 - which btw, I'm curious as to why I was charged $1.41 for a large at this location when I'm ALWAYS charged $1.40 at the one on mathilda!!!????,2,2,37.3854949,-121.9954211,Sunnyvale,United States,37.3854949 -121.9954211,tb_burgerking,2024-12-25 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

Chances are we may not get the chance to visit when they are actually open, so heed my warning: THIS PLACE IS NOT 24 HOURS!!

When I read pies, I think it is all their pies. Nope. Their "specialty" pies are more and when you call them out on it they are rude and don't care. Like the customer is supposed to be able to mind read, pies means only apple pie. It was annoying to be treated so rudely over cold mcd pies.

8432,God these McDonald's people don't want to work I've gone several times at 2 in the morning and they always tell me it's the breakfast menu, and when I check on Uber the menu is the regular menu, it's just that they don't t want to make my food, and there are several times that they have done it to me really that horrible.

I do not recommend this place at all, rather they should close it, I have gone several times at 2am to place my orders and they simply say that the menu they have is for breakfast and they never want to take out my order when I go at that time, and likewise with Uber eats orders.

8473,The prices are better in Utah than Idaho or Minnesota. Also, the McDonald's app has great deals. If you do the survey on the recite than you get a buy one get one free discount.
Since I have frequented McDonald's for a long time, I must admit that I have mixed sentiments regarding the eatery. On the one side, the meal is typically pretty decent, and I like the quick and convenient service. However, there are some problems that I've come to realize over time that make me feel like the experience isn't as positive as it once was.

The rising costs of the products on the menu are one of my main worries. Every time I visit McDonald's, it seems like the costs have increased once again. This makes it challenging to continue frequenting them as much as I once did, especially with the availability of more economical fast food alternatives.

Another problem is that McDonald's used to give frequent and significant discounts and promotions, but lately they seem to be less frequent and generous. This is disappointing because I've always valued the ability to occasionally save a few dollars on my lunch.

Having said that, there are still a few aspects of McDonald's that I genuinely value. The majority of the cuisine is delicious and good, and the quickness of service is still unmatched. The restaurant is always spotless and well-kept, making it a perfect choice if you need a fast dinner on the run. Overall, I would say that McDonald's is still a good option for fast food, but because of the rising costs and less promotions, it has lost its place as my top pick. However, a typical McDonald's burger and fries are a great choice if you're searching for a quick and delectable dinner.,4,2,40.7590573,-111.8973832,Salt Lake City,United States,40.7590573 -111.8973832,tb_burgerking,2025-01-05 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

8580,Posting this review in hopes that someone sees it. My number one complaint is the hours listed; it says 24hrs but that is not true. I'm not sure when they actually close, but I've been there at midnight, way later around 2am and 3am, and they're closed. The funny thing is that there's usually someone inside to tell me that they're closed.. I don't mind that they close early, but they need to correct their hours if that's the case. I frequently get off work rather late and I'm usually pretty hungry, I can go somewhere else but this location ~would~ be convenient for me for how close it is to my work. It's also frustrating that they allow me to pay on the app and then not get my food. Please adjust your hours online and on the app so people like me don't get their hopes up.,1,0,40.7590573,-111.8973832,Salt Lake City,United States,40.7590573 -111.8973832,tb_burgerking,2024-07-22 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

8666,Pretty good experience, considering I didn't buy anything this time.  Not too spectacular to get around the peeps hangin around outside for no reason... but it IS downtown... and the only McDonald's for a pretty big radius.  Inside was pretty good, with the new self-order station things.  They've recently done some good renovations.

8721,Poor slow service an older man came to my table showed me words on his phone saying I had 30 minutes to finish my food and leave.
I asked the cashier about the Man and he claimed he is security and that even though I had paid for my items I could only be there 30 minutes.
I asked to speak with a supervisor and was told there was not one on duty that day. I then asked for corporate office phone number and was told they don't have it.

8697,This place is very dirty the employees are very rude. They got mad cause we asked for ketchup. Then we stayed in to eat and the employees are talking and putting down all the customers. They have been putting the men and lady's in the same bathroom cause the men's is closed and then my daughter went to use the bathroom the lady up front said there is 2 men in there cause there is closed. So she went in then the security guard need to use it and then the employees where talking about my daughter I went up there and told them that If they would take better Care and clean your place it would be up. Plus you have food over every where they don't wash there hands they don't clean the tables then you ask for a wash cloth to clean they say we don't have any clean. There is so many drug dealers here even the workers are sale I ng inside in the lobby in the parking lot.. I will never come here again I'm also calling the cops on the drug deals I seen.

8702,The worst drive thru service I've ever had anywhere. From the time I started paying attention to how long I was waiting in line til the time I was given my food was 48 mins. At least 10 mins before that I was waiting in line not paying attention to how long I'd been there.  So roughly an hour to get my food. Then only to be treated rudely  by the cashier, because somehow I was supposed to know they wanted cash only. Not sure why, since I had no choice but to run my debit card and it went through just fine and in a normal amount of time. I'll never go there again.

8705,I don't go to McDonald's often but I've been here twice in the last year, both times were terrible. I went through the drive through both times. One time during the lunch hour, I didn't  get one of my burgers. I got the rest of a meal but the quarter pounder never made it  in the bag. I didn't know until I got home.

8712,I am highly enraged with their service. They didn't specify on their signs in the parking lot that I couldn't leave the parking lot for more than five minutes. They booted my truck and I had to pay him with my food in hand. I've tried talking to the store manager, McDonald's main office and submitted a complaint. All I get it's the run around, hung up on and berated. I'm not much for posting these kinds of things, but I'm out money I feel wasn't owed, and feel highly taken advantage of.,1,2,40.7590573,-111.8973832,Salt Lake City,United States,40.7590573 -111.8973832,tb_burgerking,2025-04-18 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885
8715,McDonalds was fine; the people I went with sucked. But honestly this place is really sketch, they even have a security guard at the front door in case things go sideways. If you are wondering HOW things could go sideways, you wouldn't have to expand your view further then the amount of druggys that go to this McDonalds. Half of them don't even buy anything, they just stand around (to heat up I presume) waiting for the security to kick them out. The other half stand in line and figure out that they can't buy anything at the front desk then leave. Normally I wouldn't have a problem with this if they kept to themselves like everyone else ordering something at the McDonald's, but they would  randomly yell, ask questions, pan handle, and just were being a general nuisance. I understand that an establishment can't control who their costumers are, so it's not exactly the MD's fault, but still this Micky D's should be avoided at all costs for that reason. I give them 2 stars instead of one because the good customer service and magically clean bathroom. Seriously these cashiers have to deal with a lot of weird stuff and they somehow aren't mentally broken by the end of the day. I went at 11 at night which probably affects my review, but from the first impression I'm not inclined to go again to find out how it is in the day unless it was simultaneously the only restaurant, I was starving more than a communist in the gulag, and I lost my ability to cook food myself.

8720,I was driving through the area with a friend and had to settle for this McDonald's after an hour and a half search for an open location that would serve me. However, I found out this location also did not have a working ice cream machine. How can all the machines be down in a city at once? This is some terrible service. My drive thru order taker was rude and had no idea how to process a cash payment. The driving lanes are also an apparent problem for the usual people coming here at night as two vehicles swerved into me and attempted to go in front of me in order to exit while I was at the ordering spot.,1,2,40.7590573,-111.8973832,Salt Lake City,United States,40.7590573 -111.8973832,tb_burgerking,2024-08-21 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

8728,really this is a 4.5 star review. this McDonald's is located downtown salt lake city and everyone who lives here knows that parking downtown is almost impossible sometimes. Now mind you this parking lot is massive for McDonald's. way bigger than what the store needs. so people try to take advantage of McDonald's by parking here and going elsewhere.

For those idiots that are crying about their car getting booted, they were obviously trying to take advantage - even if they were McDonald's customers. There's signs posted all over that are plain as day stating 30 minute parking only otherwise subject to getting booted or towed.  the sign also blatantly says DO NOT LEAVE THESE PREMISES WITHOUT YOUR VEHICLE. so for everyone else crying, try reading the freaking sign. You know those metal signs cost money and they weren't custom made for entertainment or cosmetic purposes. use your brains......

on another note I visited here my first time just now. food was as expected for McDonald's but it's not like a good cook could make that any better. staff was fast, friendly, and effective. And my order was accurate. -.5 a star for closing the lobby at night but once again I don't blame them.

Fortunately for this particular location, the staff are all very nice and the food is as good as McDonald's gets.

8757,I would love the exact location McDonald's i dined at. This one employee only seemed to be against having me eat there. The woman cashier literally did'nt want to order with the 2 for one menu sandwich deal i just recieved on on my phone. She wouldn't offer me a pen to write my code on the receipt, so i used a penny to write the code, so she tells me it's invalid, but i wrote the exact code and it looked as though i wrote in oencile. She immediately try calling security, so i asked the other employees for a manager. The manager was very understanding, and even after helped with all and left to the back, the woman tells me how this is my last order and i have 14 minutes left to eat. It was ammusing so i played the idiot customer roll. I definitely appreciate the manager's understanding for i was also a little short on exact cash, so you can already guess how the woman treated me about that. On the plus side I enjoyed my meal !!,4,2,40.7590573,-111.8973832,Salt Lake City,United States,40.7590573 -111.8973832,tb_burgerking,2024-06-14 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885
8758,This Store is the highest priced store, probably the most unfriendly and unprofessional in Utah. The heavy set Hispanic lady at the counter had just taken an order from the young man a head of me and would not take my order. She was going to make me do my order on the kiosk. When I told here no, that I would go somewhere else before I would do that, she told me goodbye. Yes, I am done with mcdonalds. You are not getting another dime of my hard earned money ever. if you continue these business tactics I will be happy to hear you are in bankruptcy. Enjoy the time you have left. Just a side note I have been going to this mcdonalds for over 3 years at least one day per week. Never again! Good thing Wendy's right around the corner was more than happy to take my order and my money.

8772,We were waiting in the drive thru on a Sunday morning. We were asked for our order only AFTER WE had said something about asking if our order was going to be taken and after having 5 other cars in the drive thru next to us  had gone. We started ordering and then the employee on the intercom said mid order "hold on I'm helping a customer" Um isn't that what you're supposed to be doing with us? I said screw it and drove off.

I honking horn employees looks at me and walks away. I stay there for another 15 minutes waiting and still nobody takes my order. And all the while I watch at least 12 other cars pull up to drive thru sit and wait and eventually leave cause nobody is taking orders. If your not going to do your job as an employee of McDonald's let the customers know so they don't have to wait  for nothing. By the way I had to give one star to post this.

8783,I have never encountered a restaurant so rude before. We arrived there at 10:53 they close at 11, I know it's tabu to show up at a restaurant right before close, but we were 6 hours away from home and hungry. Not only were the doors already locked, but the three employees plus a security guard would not come to the door or even acknowledge we were there.

8784,Had my car booted by 2 of the dumbest people I have ever met while my girl friend was buying a soda and I was buying wine for a lovely night.  There are 3 total signs displaying this premise, but 2 are on the opposite side of the lot and one is not reflective for their 7-10 night shift of booting/towing.  The signs also say people who aren't patrons will be booted, which I by extension was. My night was spent arguing with the employees and the tow company instead.

8786,Extremely rude lady in the morning. I spoke to her with a smile and that did not deter her from the destain she showed, from what I assume because she had to serve me. Waaay too many other McDonald's around for me to need to deal with that in the morning.

8795,The area is surrounded by homeless people so there is a strict 30-minute time limit on eating inside the restaurant. The bathrooms are locked and even asking multiple times to use one I was not given access. My fiance found some kind of blueish chunk in his burger and that ended it for us.

8798,This McDonalds forces customers to use the new machines. I couldn't order a large orange juice on my breakfast meal so I asked an employee for help. She didn't know how to order that from the machine either. She told me just order the small and that she would get me a large. While I'm waiting for my order another employee (I think it was the manager) told me I owed 50 cents for the large orange juice. She seemed annoyed with me and maybe the young girl too because we didn't know how to order the large OJ  I paid the 50 cents but was unhappy with how unfriendly and the whole experience was. I won't be back to this particular McDonalds.,1,0,40.7590573,-111.8973832,Salt Lake City,United States,40.7590573 -111.8973832,tb_burgerking,2024-07-08 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885
8799,I'm not sure what anyone who has lived in Utah expects when trying to dine in this area. It's pretty common knowledge that downtown is the heart of the homeless and many drug addicts. Not to mention this location is one block from pioneer park and very close to the road home/gateway area. I'm not excusing any rude or bad experiences but maybe just a bit more patience and compassion? It's fast food. Don't like the area?

8801,Its an average McDonalds. And i would have rated it 3 stars or higher. But there is always   A rude and sometimes and literate security guard who in morning doesn't speak any English the only English he does know is typed on his cellphone which he charmingly shows you if you don't buy something quick enough he says if you don't buy something get out then at night there's another security guard that isn't that much better he does speak English but again all he ever says is by something or leave,2,0,40.7590573,-111.8973832,Salt Lake City,United States,40.7590573 -111.8973832,tb_burgerking,2024-06-20 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

What most people don't know is that the other manager never put the effort needed for the store, therefore most slacked off... I've worked here about 3 to 4 months and like it so far, but some managers aren't the nicest... me, I've been working for Mc'Donalds for about a year, I come in everyday with a smile on my face no matter how bad my day is. I read these reports and think " these bad employees/managers make not only themselves look bad but me too! I will continue to have great customer service, most people get mad we take too long... the Damn store has broken appliences every week... yeah they should replace it, but won't, just keep repairing it till its done... anyways point being, very disappointing knowing we still get a bad review when I try hard to make everyone happy.

8859,Is this Mcdonalds or some strange car booting  entity governed by sketchy  people?   Very strange booting  practices.  They film you leaving your car, yet say nothing. The sign is too high and barely visible. They basically  boot your car for not going straight to  McDonald's .

I left to get a wine then grab something from Mcdonalds as well since i was hungry. However, on my way to  liquor store an old man told me to go back grab my car since it will be booted. It already had been booteed ONLY 3-4 mins later when i ran back.

They wouldn't take it off so i kept complaining. Hey said  i should eaither pay $75  now, or $250 after it's towed .

9421,For one usually it's only for coffee and to get away from the office as I stopped eating McDonald's food. The problem I faced recently was a homeless person who walked up to me and asked for 2 dollars for bus fare. When the bus stop is like 2 to three blocks down the road. I said I will buy you something to eat or drink but not give money. So,  for folks or tourists who get folks coming to them asking for money I suggest trying to offer food to them is more important then money. One thing about DC is there is alot of resources for folks who need money for bus fare or anything can find. Food too they know where to go. It's up to them to make that move. Another major situation I noticed is the McDonald's need some updating. I might know why they keep it so dull looking because McDonald's operates with the homeless so I guess they don't want to make it too comfortable. I been to much better ones who got nice and cool lounge chairs couches and OMG this one just looks ragged.,2,2,38.9054561,-77.0442355,Washington,United States,38.9054561 -77.0442355,tb_burgerking,2024-10-03 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

10034,You have never experienced a food establishment like this one before. Probably because they've all been shut down. I've been reluctantly stopping in this place while shopping in Macy's for many many years and it's the same experience everytime. At this point, I do it for the entertainment. The kiosk and ordering setup is a recipe for disaster, just for starters. But you will usually wait 30-45 minutes just to be told that all the food and everything you ordered is sold out. If you're lucky enough to get your food, and it seems edible, there's 0% chance the dining room will be open. With all that said, it's not even the worst part. The staff are the craziest, rudest, nastiest human beings you will ever experience. They have zero filter. They scream and curse at eachother and the customers. One time I got yelled at for asking for sweet and sour sauce and they then proceeded to gather and talk about me asking for sweet and sour sauce, as if there's something wrong with that. After ignoring the request I asked again and she made an over exaggerated movement while rolling her eyes and putting her hand out, telling me it was $1. For 1 sauce. It was the best entertainment I've ever received for the money.,1,2,40.750831,-73.9890961,New York,United States,40.750831 -73.9890961,tb_burgerking,2024-07-13 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

10054,This staff does not regard the publicly posted hours, or the manager does not pay them to clean up after hours.

Still, they only had fountain drinks, old coffee, stale mcnuggets, and ONE stale fish filet available. They had decided to clean all equipment and stop making food well before closing.

10222,I'm from a foreign place and I just happened to stop in this McDonalds for a quick bite. These are the things I noticed. #1. Active on site security inside the establishment. I felt like I was being scrutinized. I assume shady things go on here. #2. I found out this McDonalds is located in an area called skid row. #3. The price of the food here is above the average price of the rest of the united states of america. #4. There isn't really a lot of friendly interaction between the clerk and the guest as well. For the most part this is what I gathered from this place. Taking into account that it was the first and only time I've been there.

No apology and lie about I ever placed order they put in.  Very rude and ignorant. She did not speak English but deny about putting wrong order and accused me of placing order that I would never have placed. Food was cold and bread was hard as burn.

10775,If I could give this place 0 stars, believe me, I would. By far the worst McDonald's I have EVER been to in the world. I came in to buy a bottle of water (would never even consider eating here given the lack of cleanliness). I waited about five minutes until someone finally told me that they do not have any bottles left. I told them a large fountain water was fine, with ice. Keep in mind - MAYBE 2 people at this McDonald's speak English. Luckily this woman understood me when I communicated what I wanted. I watched her get the cup, fill it with ice, and place it beside the machine! For someone that is just waiting for a drink, pour it, and hand it to the customer. There were maybe a dozen people waiting for their orders. I did not have any other items to wait for - just the water. I waited another 5 minutes to see if someone would just hand me the cup. No one did. I pushed my way through to the front, and got my cup. It was absolute chaos in there; a brutally unorganized establishment. The cashier could have simply turned around, gotten me the bottle of water (or in this case, tell me there are none and pour me a fountain drink), and be on my way. Wasted 10-15 minutes in this place.,1,2,25.7902955,-80.1320774,Miami Beach,United States,25.7902955 -80.1320774,tb_burgerking,2024-09-07 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

10870,I would give it -5 if I could.
Total DISGRACE to McD brand.
We placed an order and paid at the self-serve kiosk. Receipt did not print out. Took our order # in vain hope of seeing the food. No such luck. You need to push yourself through the crowd at checkout counter to wait for order to come out. After 10+ minutes, we heard "quatro" screamed out by an employee.  That could have been our order, except it was missing few pieces, and none of the employees at food handout desk spoke any English to understand what I was telling them. NONE.  And my Spanish was not good enough to get the point t across either.
I went back in line, waited another 10mins to speak to a woman taking orders manually, who had to ask for an English speaking manager to troubleshoot our order.  Eventually, order was remedied, handout employee was instructed in Spanish how to fix our order, which she did, finally handing food to us with a farewell message of "go cuno".
You can lookup what that means, or avoid our mistake and NEVER go to this McD at all costs.,1,2,25.7902955,-80.1320774,Miami Beach,United States,25.7902955 -80.1320774,tb_burgerking,2024-09-30 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

I live at the corner, so I did not have a single experience. It was multiple ones, and it is always the same terrible service. Once I had to wait 30 minutes for a simple and 'should be quick' coffee. But the last time I went there was the worst. I stayed around 20 minutes in the counter and nobody was capable to ask me if was in need of something. I was picking an order up, which took me almost 1 hour (20 minutes until somebody talked to me + 30 minutes waiting for the food).

I saw 2 buses stopping in to feed their passengers during my short visit here, on top of the regular customers and/or those that are traveling by cars. Just like those working at Mickey D's over the border in the Canadian side (mainly showing French), these workers only spoke English and weren't too thrilled about French-only customers. I used the app to place my order, which was more convenient and the workers seemed to appreciate that more, since they don't have to deal with extra people face-to-face.

11946,Service is slow, even even when the place is empty. I wouldn't dare go when the place is actually busy. It's a bit expected since it's so close to the border.

11949,Always double-check your order when you get it. Be patient. So many irate customers here. It's unreal. If you come during a busy time, use the self-serve kisoks. I have never seen them open more than one register since the remodel. All of the excellent staff were let go when they rebuilt the store and didn't come back. This particular store is the best argument for a $20 minimum wage. Maybe if people earned more they might be more motivated or they could hire people who are enthusiastic.,1,2,44.9814099,-73.4598199,Champlain,United States,44.9814099 -73.4598199,tb_burgerking,2024-08-21 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885
11950,Worst Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich...chicken was like rubber.

Husband had 2 Cheeseburgers and they were not great either.

11951,We are frequent customers of this restaurant.  While the food was good, the inside was a mess!  Every garbage can was overflowing, with stacks of garbage piled up on all of them.  The tables were littered with paper and garbage. There were papers all over the floor, even by the register.  At the drink station, there were scattered cups and catsup splattered on the counter and floor.  Counter service was excruciatingly slow.  Since we really like the renovation and usually great service, we will probably give it one more shot.  We were there almost a half hour and so no one in the front cleaning.  Hopefully they can address and correct the problem.,1,2,44.9814099,-73.4598199,Champlain,United States,44.9814099 -73.4598199,tb_burgerking,2024-06-30 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885
11957,Wow... This McDonald's is beyond awful. So many bad experiences!

For one, outside the place smells like a landfill. The inside is covered in flies and old decorations from months ago. Every table is dirty, the bathrooms are atrocious and the garbage is overflowing. If that were tolerable, the food certainly is it. There's always something wrong with the order or the food is old and stale or overcooked. We have had multiple issues with their soft drinks machine. Either the soda is warm, there is no carbonation or both. If someone suggests I go to this McDonald's again, I'll kindly tell them I'll eat my own foot after trouncing around in manure. There's no reason that cheap food has to be so lacking in quality.,1,0,44.9814099,-73.4598199,Champlain,United States,44.9814099 -73.4598199,tb_burgerking,2024-07-05 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885
11963,Hello

I was stunned to read reviews of this location on Google.  Not our experience at all.

My wife and I both agree that this was the finest, cleanest, friendliest McDonalds we have ever been to ... dating back to the mid 1970's!  That's a lot of McDonalds all across Ontario, Quebec and probably 30 states in the USA.

We stopped on our way through for a quick bite at about 11:30 a.m. Thursday May 9 and again at about 1:30 p.m. Monday May 13.

We loved the staff, the patriotic decorations and just the overall welcoming atmosphere.

What a place.  Hope they keep it up!,5,2,44.9814099,-73.4598199,Champlain,United States,44.9814099 -73.4598199,tb_burgerking,2024-06-22 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885
11965,Worst service in years. 10pm at night. Only car in the drive thru. 20 minutes for chicken tenders and fries. No explanation given. "We are working on it".

11966,This place has the worst service they kept giving us the wrong order and actually had his pay for someone else's. the area took a while to correct and then we still had to wait for our food for another 10 minutes or so. This was all done through the drive-thru and I expected better service the New York City from this place but I definitely didn't get it. the food actually wasn't that good either I remember feeling sick after I got home later so I definitely don't recommend going to this McDonald's.,1,2,44.9814099,-73.4598199,Champlain,United States,44.9814099 -73.4598199,tb_burgerking,2024-12-07 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

11971,I only went in to use the bathroom and get a refreshment, but they were promoting "Lobster Rolls!" So I ordered one. One of the best Lobster Rolls I ever had!

12600,I usually order McDonalds through the drive thru, but the line was very long so I decided to order inside since there was no line. Now I see why everyone orders at the drive thru.

It smelled really bad inside (like a restroom) and the ceiling was leaking behind the food service line which makes me question the quality of the food. On top of that there were homeless people lingering around. One asked me for money TWICE. Once before I ordered and once afterwards. The cashier also didn't know what she was doing, she kept asking the manager for help making service slow.

12981,There's nothing like eating a spicy Mc chicken at the legendary pier.
The prices are good (as always). I highly recommend the dollar menu, in this case, 2 Mc chickens for only $4. The taste is very good! For the price of course. And the spicy one tastes even better. Service was very fast, but it can get very packed in the afternoon. Plenty of seats and restrooms are available as well (it gets packed, too). Pickup available. The everyday McDonald's, but placed in a crowded and convenient spot. We highly recommend spicy Mc chicken with extra buffalo sauce!,5,2,34.0122192,-118.4945396,Santa Monica,United States,34.0122192 -118.4945396,tb_burgerking,2025-03-21 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

13009,No drive thru, enough parking. Crowded but fairly quick. They had the front doors open and I could feel the air moving, not stuffy. Mask optional at the time (July/28/22). All employees were wearing masks. All employees were pleasant or acceptably neutral and doing a good job. Bathrooms and tables clean.  Floors looked pretty good too considering the large amount of foot traffic. Indoor and outdoor tables. Whenever someone got up, a worker appeared shortly after to spray and wipe down the table. In person you can order at  cashiers or use one of the 8 self-service screens. I believe you could also order through the app. There's a scanner at the bottom of the payment pinpad.

Saw a guy come in who "looked" homeless and 2 security guards immediately swarmed in and ushered him out. It was kind of impressive, yet I felt so sorry for the guy and thought security should have been more sensitive when doing the job because the man clearly wasn't all there.

Also, the men's rest room was very clean, however I'd prefer paper towels on hand in addition the the blowers. I had to touch the press down facet button and I had to touch the soup dispenser.

13077,This plave is not a good place. They used to have blacks there too. Now all hispanic and trey just remodeled. All of sudden after the remodel all the staff all like the same race. I though McDonald's was equal opportunity employer. Guess not. Today I went there to use the restroom. I was told I couldn't use the restroom unless I bought something. I explained that it was an emergency and I just have to take a number one and I will be on my way. I asked to speak to the manager, the manager told me the same thing you have to buy something. I told the manager I really had to use the restroom it was an emergency I'll be in and out that's all I need it and I was still denied. Every time I come to this place is always something. Things to give me cold food all the time I would ask for fresh food and they would make me wait 20 to 30 minutes I would just wait while standing there looking at her. I wasn't really strong with expressing myself oh, now I express myself a little bit more. I just thought that everybody should know is this place really isn't a nice place to be I wouldn't give them a dime of my money. When did they treat people and I've always treated people is not okay if I was a business owner in a McDonald's along to me I would fire the entire staff shut the McDonald's down and start new with the whole new staff of all Races and ethnicities different religions in different ways of being themselves instead of running it like Fort Knox and no one even speaks English. Not a respectable place and I think a lot of changes need to happen. The last thing that we all need is a petition being signed to shutdown a very nasty, disrespectful, unprofessional in very unreliable restaurant in one of the most popular places in California.

13606,This is the busiest McDonald's Ive ever been to. They have the process of customer care down to a science. If you order to go use a kiosk because eating in could take a while because a server has to walk the food over. They have a pastry cafe and the play area is massive. The employees are nice and gave great service. Just a heads up. I would avoid the drive thru between the hours of 7am-Midnight.

13615,BIGGEST MCDONALD'S IN THE WORLD!!!

We drove by this McDonald's and talked about how it was probably one of the biggest McDonald's in the world. After googling it it was! So we had to stop in!

It was definitely a cool experience. They offer More options than just the traditional McDonald's. We did build our own pasta and the pasta was excellent!

They also offer pizzas and different pastry options. Like cheesecake, cake, ice cream specialties.

This is a two-level McDonald's but looks to be four stories.

The first floor is the dining and kitchen. Second floor is a large play place that's two storage tall and they also have a arcade where you can earn points towards toy prizes. Kind of like Chuck e cheese..

We spent a few hours here It's spent around $30 for four of us. So it wasn't that bad.

Definitely cool to say you into the biggest McDonald's in the world!,5,1,28.4503866,-81.4714142,Orlando,United States,28.4503866 -81.4714142,tb_burgerking,2024-05-06 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885
13617,Pretty awesome place. On top of your standard items, they sell pasta, pizza and pastries. Surprisingly, the pizza and pasta was quite good, for McDonalds. The place also offers a very reasonable arcade, $5 unlimited play for 30 minutes. The only draw back to the timed purchase is that you don't earn tickets. They do have a trade in booth with prizes for your tickets.
Overall, we came here for the experience of going to the world's largest McDonalds and came out pretty satisfied with the while experience. Enjoy y'all!,5,0,28.4503866,-81.4714142,Orlando,United States,28.4503866 -81.4714142,tb_burgerking,2025-01-09 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

There was hardly enough parking for cars, let alone bigger vehicles.
We have a 26 ft Class C RV. There is no oversized parking. We got lucky with parking, but others did not.

But seriously, If your family likes McDonald's, this McDonald's is worth it!
We ordered pizza and chocolate cake.. at McDonald's!

But the most memorable part was the second floor. Not only is there an incredible, gigantic three-story all enclosed play place (with a single entry/exit point!) There is also an extremely large arcade with all sorts of v"around a corner" and can't be seen from the dining area.  For kids that "must" play a game, there are 2 dining tables with touchscreens!

There's plenty of seating (both upstairs and on the main floor) and clean bathrooms on both levels.

The kids will remember this McDonald's!,5,2,28.4503866,-81.4714142,Orlando,United States,28.4503866 -81.4714142,tb_burgerking,2025-04-10 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885
13621,Arcade and play place on second floor was awesome. This McDonald's offers pizza, pasta, and philly cheese steaks, just to name a few. Ordered from the regular menu however and fries were meh. Warm but soggy.

13628,This McDonald's has everything. Even pizza and pasta.
Bear in mind that it's a little expensive if you order items individually. So get the combos if you can that way you save money.

The place was totally renovated a few years back.

13629,If I could give it no stars i would. Me and my family have been coming to Florida for 3yrs straight now and we always wanted to stop here, but it was always packed and we could never get in. So tonight we were fortunate to get in with no traffic and when I say I wish we would've kept going. 1st I would start off with its over crowed inside, very unorganized  and no manager direction. Ordered our food at 9:05pm got our order at 9:30 my niece ordered a Belgian waffle at 9:30 on the dot at 10:00pm it still wasn't ready so I asked very politely bc I'm a very nice person if they had made our order # for the waffle the guy said it wasn't ready, but we stood there watching them make waffles and throw them on the shelf so I asked was 1 of the waffles my order he went to check each ticket and sadly not 1 of them was my the order #. I also witnessed him ask 1 of the workers about it. She was an older woman when I say she was very rude didn't care and walked off as he was asking her so at that point I just wanted a refund. Oh no, but it doesn't stop there got in the car my whole order was cold and the lack of work they put into making food is ridiculous. I do not recommend this place and we will never come here again. My burger was missing a whole top layer of meat, lettuce, cheese and sauce. This is beyond ridiculous I was so exhausted with this place I just took it as a lose and went back to our place of stay. This is the worst McDonald's ever!!!!,1,2,28.4503866,-81.4714142,Orlando,United States,28.4503866 -81.4714142,tb_burgerking,2024-09-24 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885
13632,Since I'm known as "Jimmy McRib" I had to take the opportunity of visiting the world's largest McDonalds, even though it meant and extra hour and fifteen minute drive each way....  Anyways, this place is huge, and legendary among fast food junkies like myself for the fact that they serve pizza and pasta.  I would have been more impressed if they had the McRib too, but it was not to be, even at the world's largest McDonalds.

This was an incredibly busy place, even at 9:30pm.  There are tons of local hotels and tourists were everywhere, with most of them speaking a language besides English.  The restaurant wasn't the cleanest, but that had to be due to the fact that they are open 24/7 and always busy.  To my surprise, the bathrooms were very clean and nice.

Anyways, what is unique at this McDonalds:
- Hand dipped hard ice cream
- Multiple stories, with an arcade and playland upstairs
- A pizza and pasta section
- A big fish tank in the lobby

It was difficult to get into the parking lot due to construction and traffic, but there was plenty of parking.  The one side of the building has a giant neon Ronald McDonald which was cool.  I wanted to try the pizza or pasta, but unfortunately I had eaten a nice dinner about an hour earlier and only had room for a hamburger, which I ordered through the app.  It was pretty hectic inside, with tons of kiosks for ordering, which was helpful since they had different language selections to match the language of those ordering.  Some of my family got hand scooped ice cream, but it was a nightmare, as nobody was working that section, and we had to wait ten minutes after waiting in the busy line at the counter to ask for somebody to help us.  But, they eventually got their hard ice cream and it was good.

It was definitely neat to see this McDonalds, but it was a bit too busy for me, and the workers said that this was light traffic as compared to how busy it gets during the day.,4,2,28.4503866,-81.4714142,Orlando,United States,28.4503866 -81.4714142,tb_burgerking,2024-07-25 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885
13633,We arrived at this large fast-food chain store at 4:00 pm and were surprised.  Bathrooms with no water taps and unused urinals and toilets.  ATM and soda machine out of use.

13635,Really cool atmosphere.  However, lines are extremely long (even @ 11 at night). They have about 8-10 kiosks to make your order, but only 1 was operational when I visited.

This restaurant looks nice and modern from the road but as soon as you step in ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ it is dirtyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ deep down dirty with dirty tables and dirty floors.

The layout means there are very few seats down stairs, so up we went and discovered some giant soft play area/arcade machines - they didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½  seriously? There isnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t a single vegetarian in Florida?

13647,I've obviously been to McDonald's before, but none like this! Tried the pizza and I'll have to admit, it's not perfect, but it's definitely not bad. Crust is a little thin for me. The activities are upstairs and it's like a small Dave & Busters. If you've never been, think about it.

But our fries weren't cooked and they weren't even filled up.  We tried getting service and there was rudeness to help us.  I was seriously underwhelmed at food and service.   It wasn't even busy when we went.,3,2,28.4503866,-81.4714142,Orlando,United States,28.4503866 -81.4714142,tb_burgerking,2025-02-13 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

13669,The pizza is really good.  We got 3 and everyone liked it.  About the size of a medium pizza hut pizza, but oven fired (yes,  there are stone fired pizza ovens in here!) and thin crust. The Philly cheesesteak was really good and the chocolate explosion cake was tasty. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
If you order to eat there and order pasta or the cheesesteak, it comes on REAL plates/ pasta bowls.  Thought that was neat.

Not surprisingly,  our fries were cold and the Big Mac was missing a burger... pretty consistent with all other McDonald's on that point. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

13680,Very busy McDonald's. They have, on the second floor, some games for the kids and families, and they also bring the food to your table. They have the regular McDonald's menu, but they also offer others kinds of things like pizza and pasta. I had the opportunity to try the pasta, and it was good. They have different options of pasta, sauces, veggies, and meats that you can add.
Now, this is what happened to me. When you make your order at the screen, and you order pizza or pasta, it is done at a different food station from where they do the regular food. After a few minutes, I got the pasta at my table, but the rest of the order was missing. Sadly, they lost the rest of my order (happy meal and a coffee). After 20 minutes, I talked to the manager about my order, and she didn't  hesitate to help me. She was very nice and she personally took care of my order.
If you ask me if I recommend this McDonald's, it depends. If you're looking for a McDonald's that offers more than burgers, yes. If you want your kids to have a little bit of fun without a time restriction, yes, it is a good option.  But if you are in a rush, no, I don't recommend this McDonald's.,3,2,28.4503866,-81.4714142,Orlando,United States,28.4503866 -81.4714142,tb_burgerking,2024-05-29 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885
13685,I was shocked to go into a Mcdonald and order grilled chicken alfredo. This McDonald in Orlando, Florida, has a kid area and arcade. They also have pizza that can be purchased. It has two floors accessible with an elevator.

13686,This McDonald's is really nice. Super big and offers other foods other then McDonalds lol. It also has a second floor with more seating and a arcade section for fun. They offer a tap menu option and table service. So once your done ordering thru the self tap options you grab a number and have a seat.

We ordered our regular McDonald's food with the addition of a strawberry and banana waffle. Which was bomb.

I did feel like the store was a bit dirty. But it was probably cause it had a rush. After we left it calmed down and the employees were cleaning.

It is on the more expensive side. We ordered two Mcdoubles (which we had a coupon and applied it) large fries, a small drink and the waffle. The total was 19 bucks... It would have been 23...

13688,This location is said to be the largest McDonald's in the world! We stopped in after a day at Universal. We arrived after 11 and it was crazy busy. Our order took at least 30min before it was ready...but under the very busy circumstances it was understandable. They have unique dishes such as pasta and wood fired pizza which seemed very popular. Multi level seating....games room and various entertainment segments through the store as well to make the experience even better. Lots of free parking and dual drive thru.

13691,It's a great location if you want to wait 30 minutes for extremely subpar food. Fries are stale, food is bland as hell and in pretty sure there is mold on one of my sandwiches?

Also come here so the kid could burn off energy, but the playplace was closed.

Annnyyyyyways. Probably won't return.,1,2,28.4503866,-81.4714142,Orlando,United States,28.4503866 -81.4714142,tb_burgerking,2025-03-16 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885
13696,Checked this off my list.

What
I thought id have to check out the biggest play area at a McDonalds.. I actually have lived in Orlando for over 15 years and today was the first time I went. Upon reading some review, I just realized it is the largest... and an actual tourist attraction... I took a toddler her to play and BOY what an experience.

Environment
This is right off a busy intersection, i-Drive and sand lake. The parking can get packed.. The building is huge! You cannot miss it. It is 2 stories and the play area is quite big as well, with an arcade inside. There are 2 stories, you enter the play area on level 2. You order the food downstairs and you can sit upstairs. There are a lot of self ordering machines so it makes ordering go a little faster? Upstairs was VERY HOT! Like there was no AC... and when you walk downstairs it was cool.

Niceness of the staff
Barely had any interactions with the staff. It was ok.

Dollar
They also sell pizza, and that was ok... it starts at $9 and every topping is at least $1

Yes?
Probably not... not really recommended.,2,2,28.4503866,-81.4714142,Orlando,United States,28.4503866 -81.4714142,tb_burgerking,2024-07-16 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

13714,This McDonald's has a pizza and pasta area made to order and is very good but like any McDonald's it's hard to find the staff that are willing to work in such a busy and crazy place. You cannot order with a real person inside. You have to order from a kiosk and they don't always get your order right or forget something. There is a drive through that is kind of like a race track and wraps around the building with 2 or 3 lanes and if your order is wrong, oh well, so be it. Just take it or leave it.

Yes, I know I should have checked for myself, but I like to trust people to take pride in their work. Before you say that they were busy, no, they were not. But on a really good note, the lady taking my order at the drive-thru was fantastic at customer service.

13726,There are foods that are offered that are not offered at typical McDonald's locations, but do not be fooled. The food is similarly mediocre to all the other locations. Young children will beg to use the arcade, which is certainly not any less than a cash grab. Sure, it's fun, but it doesn't offer anything more than a normal McDonald's besides a small, money-demanding arcade, small pizzas, a few different breakfast items, and some cool desserts. Otherwise, it's a cool place to eat if you are wise with your money.,3,2,28.4503866,-81.4714142,Orlando,United States,28.4503866 -81.4714142,tb_burgerking,2025-02-20 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

13728,The fries weren't salted or flavoured, very bland. I also had a chicken bacon burger which was heavily fried and didn't taste that good. I ordered in store myself and it was quite busy, people were lining up or waiting everywhere. It was also unclear who worked there and who didn't as some people had no uniform but were wandering around behind the counter. They also serve pizza and pasta where you can choose your toppings and sauces. The ice machine was under pressure and couldn't spit ice out fast enough, the second one didn't work at all and the sweet tea was pouring too slowly so I went with something else instead.,3,0,28.4503866,-81.4714142,Orlando,United States,28.4503866 -81.4714142,tb_burgerking,2024-07-20 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

I ordered three things came out to about 7$, very decent i ate inside and in about 5 minutes a worker came to my table with my order.

The customer service was very nice and up-stairs they have a play place for the kids, they also serve pizza, pastas and cake here so it surprised me but overall great experience I will say because of the play place there is naturally a lot of parents bringing their kids so it can be very loud.,4,2,28.4503866,-81.4714142,Orlando,United States,28.4503866 -81.4714142,tb_burgerking,2024-06-20 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

13743,Don't waste your time or money. We were excited to visit here with out of town guests straight from the airport.
1. Kiosks are backed up with a bunch of people each so no where to stand, wait, or snake through with trays of food. Kiosks were glitchy and blanked out every minute.
2. It is at least 10 degrees warmer upstairs so NOT comfortable at all.
3. Even with our order number on the table no one ever brought food...after 20 minutes, i went down stairs and it was sitting there. Then there is no drink station upstairs so with an already full tray, i had to bring food up and then come down for drinks. So why did i have to pick a flavor if the only deliver an empty?
4. No one to help with service or questions. Lady upstairs spoke no English. I had to raise my hand at the counter after standing there 5 minutes to find my food just to get acknowledged.
5. After all that, found one sandwich missing. Went back again and notified i was missing the cheese steak and staff member walked to the other pasta section where it was sitting by itself.
6. Cheeseburgers were not made to order as requested on the kiosk.
7. Big mac was dry. Worst one ever.

13754,The service is always great here. All the employees always seem willing to help you, but with the volume this store does I don't believe they have enough staff. Saw a roach crawling on the 2nd floor, and all of the food we got was cold by the time we got it. Condiments are hard to find unless you go to the register area where 75 other people are in line waiting for their food and food is marked up in price because it is a tourist acctraction. Is a cool experience once or twice, but a couple miles down the road is a regular McDonald's that has fresh food every time for the same price as a regular McDonald's.,3,2,28.4503866,-81.4714142,Orlando,United States,28.4503866 -81.4714142,tb_burgerking,2024-09-28 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

13760,Very average McDonald's experience overall. Was cool because of the whole "largest McDonald's" bit, but it was extremely hectic inside with kids running and screaming everywhere. Took a while to even get the opportunity to order, then food took a while to get to us, which is understandable since it was so busy. Ice was out in 3/4 soda machines. Not a very clean place either. Pizza was alright. Very dry, flavorless crust, pretty soggy and could have used more time in the oven/ the oven could be hotter. If they put like 20% more effort into the flavor of the pizza it would be a lot better. Onion "slivers" were also just onion chunks. Not a big deal, just a little misleading. But what else you expect from a McDonalds. Food is a little pricier than the McDonald's I'm used to as well. Would probably have a better experience making the effort to dine elsewhere.,4,2,28.4503866,-81.4714142,Orlando,United States,28.4503866 -81.4714142,tb_burgerking,2024-10-10 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

13778,Because it is the largest McDonald, it is a place where you go there so you can scratch off your bucket list.
It is very crowded,  very noisy,  a lot of kids, of course.
They have pizza, coffee, and sweets beside the regular menu.

I think the staff works hard and as fast as they can. In my opinion,  the management has to step in big time in order for this place to run flawsly.

The self order machines two or three didn't work,  so it added to the slow service.
Upstairs is an arcade game room. You need coins. It is very stuffy and even more noisy .

Waited for ages to receive our food and when it did arrive, half of it wasn't there and some of it was cold. Tried to find a helpful member of staff - we're still looking... Went to get some drinks, all of which were 'horrible' as quoted by another customer, even the water tasted like sewage. We ended up leaving with what we had and wondering how long the symptoms of cholera take to set in. So safe to say we wouldn't recommend and would 100% not return.

I turn to see where she was heading & it was to where my son was sitting. I adked her why the cover was off & she couldn't answer!! To top it all off there was hair under one of my pieces of pizz!!

One thing I hate is having to mix my own flurry when they usually mix it up for you. Other than that little flaw... I definitely feel safe, Welcomed, No rude staff. When their busy, we have to wait a 1H for the food, when their not.. we get our food within 20-30 minutes.

14032,The low score is for the Maroon Shirt Manager on 4.3.23 who took the phone off the hook and still allowed the app to sell curbside orders that would never be delivered due to the phone being off the hook. Then, making people sit in the lobby and ignore them while she sat and "responded to surveys." Well ma'am  here is one for you, since apparently surveys take president over service.

It took the Blue Shirt Manager realizing nothing was being done up front to get anything done. She realized the Maroon Shirt Manager had the phone off the hook for 4 hours, apologizing, correcting issues, and holding people accountable to get anything going.

14044,I went through the drive-through at this Mc Donalds and had no issue with ordering. However, it did take unusually longer to go through the Drive Thru.

To that end, the food was hot and fresh. However, they did overstuff the bags with my order. As when I got one of the bags ripped and my food fell on the floor.

Lastly, if you go to this McDonalds be sure to double check if the bag is overfilled and ask for an additional bag if you need it.

I would like to point out that this particular crew and manager tonight provided most excellent service. And the manager was great at keeping employees motivated which I don't often see elsewhere.

14061,I've been to this McDonald's twice now and it's never been faster than 30 minutes. Even with a simple order like fries and a drink.
Ordered mobile and it took over 30 minutes for my order and I watched everyone standing in line to order get ignored for 20 minutes at a time. Which, after reading reviews seems like it is the norm to wait 30 minutes for a single mcgriddle.
After I waited over 30 minutes for my order, they forgot my drinks (which I waited at the counter for another 5 minutes before anyone even asked what I needed) and my order was wrong. But I wasn't about to sit another half hour for them to remake a different sandwich. Not a big deal.
Not the employees fault necessarily... just seems like they're EXTREMELY  understaffed!
Shame on upper management for allowing this to happen. I wouldn't want to work in that environment either.,1,0,29.6762669,-98.6345801,San Antonio,United States,29.6762669 -98.6345801,tb_burgerking,2025-01-31 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

So, you get to spend 20 to 30 minutes waiting in the drive through line to place an order that half the time they screw up.  Happened again today.  A simple #1 meal with a coke.  Got only the Big Mac and nothing else.  Pointed it out to the lady and handed her the bag back.

14096,Very poor service! While on a long road trip we stopped in to get gas and coffee. Upon entering the McDonald's the floors were extremely dirty, but we came after lunch so maybe they had a busy lunch rush. Then when I stepped up to the counter to order, the menu screens were stuck on frozen 2 advertisements. Then I order 2 Caramel Mocha  Coffees. After about 3min of waiting the kid behind the counter tells me the machine broke he needs to get the manager. Come to find out the machine is on auto-clean and it will be 18min before our coffee is ready. Not wanting to wait around they tell me they can give me two regular coffees. When I tell them that regular coffee is 1$ a cup and I was charged 7.58$ for two specialty coffees they offer to make up the difference in food. That's nice and all, but we did not want nor need any food. I ask for just a refund at that point. Mind you this whole ordeal takes almost the 18min for the machine to finish cleaning but by now I just wanted to get out of there. The staff were all very young and seemed very poorly trained. While they were nice and tried to make it right, I think better training of the employees at this location is necessary. While waiting for my refund I watched multiple other customers receive the wrong order or had issues with their food. I dont often go to McDonald's but continued visits with poor service has definitely left a bad impression!,2,2,29.6762669,-98.6345801,San Antonio,United States,29.6762669 -98.6345801,tb_burgerking,2025-01-13 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

14103,Normally I would rate this with a 5 star, but lately this location has been having a lot of staff coordination.

14108,Horrible experience. There was a long line for the drive thru, so I pulled out of line thinking that a curbside order would be faster. After 15 minutes I keep seeing employees come in and out but not bringing food to the curbside orders and the line for the drive thru kept moving.  Even the car that pulled next to me gestured for me what is going on. I called the number on the sign and no one answered. I hung up and called again because at this point I was upset and couldnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t cancel my order through the app. Finally someone answered and I told I had been waiting 20 minutes at this point for my food to come out and I was to cancel my order. She said that I had to do it on the app. I told her no I already tried and I need the manager to refund me my money. She said she was the manager and I had to cancel on the app. I asked her how do you do it because I didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½nl be out soon with my refund.

14665,Good morning, Please tell me if this matters or if I'm being to sensitive or petty or overly concerned. Maybe because I didn't have my coffee this morning.

I patronize this McDonalds in Oak Park every morning. This morning I forgot my wallet. I asked the Supervisor if I could pay them the less than $5.00 breakfast tomorrow. They said so sorry No. I pleaded with this new manager that I'd never seen before. I asked for the manager that I'd spoken with on several occasions.
She refused to see me, and he stated that her response would be the same!!! I asked him what was to happen to food on the counter in front of us. He said it would be discarded!!!!

Seriously, I asked. So, I said that you'd rather throw it away then let me have it, a faithful customer.....So my lesson is now, Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson. McDonalds doesn't care about my patronizing their establishment and I'm going to seriously break my coffee habit. No more McDonalds from Oak Park on Madison for me.
A lesson well learned, can you believe my feeling was hurt when he said that my breakfast was to be discarded.,1,2,41.8796564,-87.7779131,Oak Park,United States,41.8796564 -87.7779131,tb_burgerking,2024-12-07 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

Please Oak Park government, make panhandling illegal again; most people who do this get in other people's faces and harass them and verbally abuse them. God forbid one of these people pulls a knife or gun on a customer if they say no.

On top of that, they gave me no receipt. I have no proof of this. Maybe it's in your computer, but I demand a refund since I can't get one with the delivery app, and maybe pick up the phone as I was calling this McDonald's about this over and over.

15361,We waited 20 minutes for our mobile order till we went up to a worker and told her we had a mobile order. She walked away without even saying anything and came right back out with our food which was probably just sitting aside the whole time. The fries are old I even took a picture to show.

15375,This was by far the worst experience I've had a McDonalds drive through.

To top it off, the food is usually cold and they have a hard time even understanding your orderï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï,1,2,30.3291349,-97.6606295,Austin,United States,30.3291349 -97.6606295,tb_burgerking,2025-01-14 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885
15377,What can I say, it's McDonalds.  The food is never cold or smashed. It's hit or miss on the type of employee you'll get at the drive through. They either "don't want to be here and hate the fact that you're making them work" or they "smile and make you feel welcomed". It's close to my office for a quick breakfast or lunch.

I'm editing my last post and changing my rating. I waited in the Drive-Thru for 10 minutes with no one coming on the line. The other line however three cars went through while I sat there. I pulled forward to place my order at the window and I was told that I had to drive back around. The level of unacceptable is insane.  I try to be understanding of fast food workers because I know they deal with ugly people but this takes the cake.  The day is Monday June 11th 2023 at 345pm. The morning crew is a good bunch of workers, however the afternoon crew has always been extremely slow.,1,2,30.3291349,-97.6606295,Austin,United States,30.3291349 -97.6606295,tb_burgerking,2025-02-15 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885
15379,We waited 25 min in the drive thru line to be told we had to come inside for our "mobile drive thru" order. The guy in the drive thru insisted we go inside to pick up the order. We parked in front I went inside and waited 8 mins to be asked what my order was. The cashier said she didn't have a order for my code I was giving her. She went over to the drive thru cashier and she told him he needs to process the mobile orders in the drive thru.

15383,The food temp was fine. The burger I picked was not good tasting. Nothing to do with the cooks. The place was dirty. My daughter's cup was leaking as it was broken and I had to get a new one even though they had given it to us with it filled and had to have known it was like that. Most of the workers were just standing around. Even though it was lunch time they could not take a 100.00 and there was not signs up. Thank goodness I had another form of payment.

French fries taste like they were cooked hours before being served fountain drinks taste like bath water only slightly warmer. Hours are mis-posted on the entrance door and for serving product that is already cooked and just sitting under the heat lamp they are in a league of their own when it comes to the slowness of their service.

15475,We are staying at the hotel next door. My husband checks online to make sure the restaurant and dining room are open. They are. He walks over and the doors are locked. Walks back to the hotel, takes his car through the drive through, sits for 10 minutes and receives no service although there were employees in the restaurant. He sees other cars trying to receive service but they are all being ignored. He comes back to the hotel and calls again, at least 6 times, each time it says the number is disconnected even though he had already confirmed they were open through the same number earlier. Finally someone answers the call, he asks if they are open and they said no, he asked them why they answered the phone and were in the restaurant at 1am if it is closed, they said because their job is just to answer the phone. Its clear that the employees wanted to get paid for working all night without serving any customers. My husband used to work in fast food, and I wanted to believe that the stereotypes of McDonalds employees being terrible people and workers to not be true, but this location makes the company look bad. McDonald's should fire the franchise owner, or shut this location down, because they clearly dont know how to hire dependable employees.,1,2,30.3291349,-97.6606295,Austin,United States,30.3291349 -97.6606295,tb_burgerking,2024-09-30 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

15477,The manager and or the Owner does not have business sense. Poor staffing for the late shift. I pulled up to order some french fries at 10:30 and was told it will be a 20 minute wait and to pull to the parking lot. I asked why and the person said "I have to go to school in the morning". He said the owner do the hiring and it is not his fault. 1. Bad choice of words. 2. They may need to not be a 24 hour McDonald's 3. Hire appropriate staff.
I was taken back be the unprofessionalism I was handed. And charged $2 for a small order of fries.  SMH. I am glad that my mood was good.

15483,Do you want dysentery, cholera, or one of the "Big-5"? Then eat here, otherwise you would be wise to avoid this McDonalds as if it were the plague. Immediately upon walking through the door I was stunned by an extremely offensive and pungent odor. It was so difficult to focus on much else due to the severity of the smell. This was not a smell of hamburgers or French fries, this was the smell of spilled milk that had soured and marred in the 100+ Texas heat for weeks. Truly, this smell is likely from the repeated spilling of soda at the drink stations that had either been overlooked or merely disregarded by careless employees. Beyond the smell, the sights were just as appalling. There were trays with discarded food and wrappers lining the tables as well as smashed food around the floor. Granted the trays are the result of lazy and inconsiderate people that believe they shouldn't be required to tend to their mess; the employee's should have direction from management to conduct a lobby check at set periods to ensure this doesn't result in customer  dissatisfaction. All this being said, I simply walked into the lobby to order a drink and I would have been on my merry way. I stood at the counter and waited for one of the cashiers to acknowledge that they were ready to take my order. I received numerous glances from, who I assumed was, the front of store worker. I was the only customer in line in the lobby, but understood that there was also a drive through at which customers were present. I waited a bit longer, received additional glances from previously said employees. Still, I was not asked for my order. I was doing nothing that would have given the appearance that I was unready to order. I was not on the phone, not fiddling with my wallet; I was standing quietly, intently looking at multiple employees that dismissed my presence. 4 employees present, 2 managers in the back and zero orders from me. This normally would not have been an issue, I would have waited a bit longer, but the lack of regard for cleanliness and the piercing stench that wafted throughout the lobby forced me to leave. I'm not likely to enter this facility nor purchase any product from this store after today. If the management and workers leave the front of the store in such a state, it forces me to wonder about the areas where customers cannot see. To all those that dare enter, 'ye be warned'.,1,2,30.3291349,-97.6606295,Austin,United States,30.3291349 -97.6606295,tb_burgerking,2024-06-05 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

15491,Wow... I mean...wow. Over 5 employees and they all need to work on their people skills. It's just so disappointing on how they attended us. Restrooms were a mess ( it wasn't even packed) and to top it off, one of the employees was eating fries out of the fry tray while preparing orders. I just don't know what else to say other than I will NEVER come back to this location.,1,2,30.3291349,-97.6606295,Austin,United States,30.3291349 -97.6606295,tb_burgerking,2024-11-19 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885
15494,I went through the drive through Friday Dec 23, 2016 at about 7:20 a.m. There was a young black female working the window where you pay, and I have to say she set the tone for my day. What a sweetheart, she was all smiles and just a joy for my first stranger encounter of the day. With the way things have been going in this country the last several months, she was a bright spot in an otherwise dreary daily grind, and I will not soon forget how she lifted my spirits all over a sausage burrito and a cup of coffee. She set the bar, good job.,5,2,30.3291349,-97.6606295,Austin,United States,30.3291349 -97.6606295,tb_burgerking,2025-01-06 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885
15495,Waited 10 minutes in front of the register.
They never Acknowledged our presence there..Employees and Manager we're just talking not doing anything.
Then the girl from the drive thru comes and takes our order...I ask who's the Manager on duty, she replies it's the guy in white shirt.
He happens to come to the counter and i told him his service here sucks..
He looks at me and says" so what, I dont care"
This is coming from the Manager...
When you first walk into this McDonald's it stinks like dirty diapers.
This location always stinks and customer service is very Horrible.
This is the only location close to my work.
Manager and employees are there for a paycheck only...NOT customer service!!!

15506,I can't tell you how much I have the new kiosk system of ordering. The employees couldn't care less if you have ordered or need to order, and that goes for the managers also. Everyone is only worried about what the lazy people in the drive-through are ordering. And to make matters worse, if you want to pay with cash, you get to order twice.

15515,This McDonald's is getting this rating not cause its McDonald's, but because time after time, it has been terribly poor service. I have had one experience where a manager told me that I was wrong. That clearly I ordered wrong. All I asked for was a double quarter pounder with cheese meal. They took down a quarter pounder with cheese meal because that's likely more common than what I ordered. And instead of admitting they may have messed up, she told me I was wrong and needed to just accept that. I have been told that they only carry 2 types of sauce for nuggets as well, which I believe isnt true. I believe they just didnt know the other ones and didnt want to find out. I have also had large fries consistently only filled about 3/4's of the way. Never once have I had a full large fries from there.,1,2,30.3291349,-97.6606295,Austin,United States,30.3291349 -97.6606295,tb_burgerking,2024-05-15 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885
15519,Was told to wait on the side of the building which is typical when long lines form in the drive thru. These guys didn't have the courtesy to bring me my food.

The best part is they stand straight up in the box just as they do on the commercials and pictures. I don't mind waiting in the sometimes long drive-thru line for fresh food.

And why is there a parking lot if we can't walk in. And how rude the associate was that I basically should have known better that they were only running the drive thru? You're better off going to the one on burbank Blvd. Who puts a double lane on a drive thru and doesn't expect problems? This isn't it McDonald's... 20 minutes sitting in a drive thru...,1,2,34.1525074,-118.3679036,North Hollywood,United States,34.1525074 -118.3679036,tb_burgerking,2025-02-27 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885
16374,I had quite possibly my worst McDonald's experience ever here. After ordering a sausage egg mcmuffin with a biscuit instead of English muffin, the order taker said

"ok I'll punch it in so it comes out a good deal for you."

Um... Ok...

When I got the order it ONLY had egg. I politely informed the person at the drive through window, but they refused to correct the order, saying in a absolute terms that this is what I ordered and if I wanted what I ACTUALLY ordered I'd have to get back in line and place a new order!!

What the hell???

17250,Whatever you do, do NOT go to this McDonald's location. There's a reason why I rated it one star and I can kindly explain why. While the food there is good, I simply cannot stare at these people the same way anymore. A hour or two ago, I showed up to get some food and there was this one woman working behind the register (I don't remember her name, but I assume she was a manager or something. She was in a blue shirt and glasses and that's all I can remember). There was an annoying beeping sound that seemed concerning and I politely asked (key word here is "politely") them to investigate it and make it stop. They didn't bother to check it, which shows that they're neglectful of the resources around their workplace. The reaction I got from this woman was 100% disrespectful and told me to get out of her store and never come back and even tried to call 911 on me. It's pretty obvious that I caught this woman on a bad day. Clearly, I was furious because I felt like she was deliberately trying to get under my skin and using that to her advantage. You know what they call people like her? A bully. I was bullied by the manager because I had a concern that needed to be addressed. I was not trying to show up on this woman at any point during my visit. I was trying to be as lenient as I possibly could. If the woman I was referring to was actually a manager of this establishment, she needs to be put in her place because that's NOT how a manager should treat her customers. I do not like being antagonized, especially by an employee and it really showed during this visit. Come to think about it, I've been checking on other reviews of this location they all had numerous problems with this particular person. Obviously, I'm heartbroken because now I don't have anywhere to go to eat after my work shift. I'm only relegated to the Chick-Fil-A a minute down the road and even I know they have better hearts and respect than this woman did (and their food is also good). As a man diagnosed with autism, I strongly advise people to stay away from this location at all costs. If you really need to go to a McDonald's, steer clear of this location. It's not worth your time and it's not worth your sanity. Also, their drink machine has been broken and flat for at least a few months and they didn't fix that either. I will be contacting corporate about the antics going afoot at this location.,1,2,39.8520594,-74.9810994,Voorhees Township,United States,39.8520594 -74.9810994,tb_burgerking,2024-08-15 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

17257,Ordered via the kiosk.

Looks like management has posted a sign, order via kiosk to get a free cookie. My order didn't contain one. I asked the associate, she was puzzled. They had to discuss with 3 other folks and finally one of them gave one with complete displeasure.

Kiosk didn't give a paper bill to provide a direct feedback. With modern tech, they should switch to a sms or email for whoever wants a digital copy.,2,2,39.8520594,-74.9810994,Voorhees Township,United States,39.8520594 -74.9810994,tb_burgerking,2024-06-20 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885
17259,Ordered a burger at the drive-through. I was made to wait for 20 minutes and when the food came I was given the wrong order. I brought it inside to talk the employees so I could get the correct food. I spoke with the manager and she was unbelievably rude. Acted like it was my fault that my daughter was given the wrong burger. I finally was given the right burger but I have no idea why the manager made it such an awful experience.
To top it off, I walked into the bathroom. There was someone sitting in the stall. He flushed and walked out. He was an employee and he didn't wash his hands. Just walked out of the bathroom and when I came out he was making burgers.

17287,Since the kiosk was introduced into the restaurants, the staff does not even acknowledge your presence. Plus, they are over-staffed. There are so many servers bringing food to the tables that they bump into each other and customers constantly. And the overcrowded staff in the back looks like pure chaos. I went to the register to place my order cause I prefer to talk to a human being, and the counter person told me to "go use the kiosk. I'm busy."

17288,Absolutely horrible place. They have people working the drive-thru speaker who can barely speak English, get the order wrong, and are not polite.  When I have ordered here, they mess up the order almost every time.  I wonder if there is a manager here because the employees seem more intent on fooling around and laughing than paying attention to their customers.  They need to get things straightened out and realize that if they don't provide better service, they will go out of business.

17311,Your company is advertising support for front line workers but your company is very disrespectful to people who are helping others. I was rushing from one state to another state to help disable children, stopped for breakfast at this location. I was told to wait so the person in drive thru could take another person's order who came after me. The person never came back on to help me even after me steady saying hello and waiting. I was about to be late for work so I left and went to dunkin donuts.You guys should NEVER advertise free meals for front line workers when its clearly a lie.

17316,I went to the McD's on Rt 561 at (Roughly) 21:45hrs to get a 1/4 pounder meal with a milkshake. During the ordering, a woman loudly voiced acrossed the floor to the young lady assisting me that she is NOT to take ANY ice cream orders after 21:30.
The employee was as stunned as I and ask why and in an Arrogant voice. She said "its because we GOTZ ( gotz) to clean the machine" Well I felt this was rude and followed up with a question to this woman. I asked,  what if I get here at 21:45 and ask for a milkshake. She again in an Arrogant voice responded with, " you aintz getting it" ( aint'z) ( The rest of the staff laughed when she made this comment)
After all this and being made to wait 15 minutes for my order, I requested a refund and to speak to the manager. I was told by this woman that no manager was available.
So I went back the next day to report this incident, I ask the front customer representative to speak with a manager. Oddly enough, she directed my attention to the woman that I had this encounter with the night before.
So not only did I get HORRIBLE customer service in a language and tone that was less than professional, I was lied to as the customer service rep..AKA Manager Nicky was available the whole time.
If Nicky is the Manager and is leading that team, it won't be long until that location starts losing customers as they just loss 1...

17333,A group of friends (6 of us total) were kicked out shortly after eating due to the "store manager's orders". Their rule is "5 kids in the restaurant at a time" because of an incident that happend a week ago where kids made a mess and broke a salt shaker. Two out of the group left and it was us 4 sitting there, having casual conversation in the side of the restaurant, and a second lady came up to us and asked us to leave again, because "football kids are coming in" and that there were too many kids at one time. Keep in mind we were not disrespectful or disruptive, McDonalds was just a place to eat, not hang out or lounge in our free time. Nearing adulthood, I felt very offended and quite frankly disrespected by store management AND their employees.

18170,I ordered a artisan chicken sandwich no tomatoes on 2/22/19 through the drive-thru and when I went to get my food they told me to pull up and wait. I waited half a hour to get this sandwich and chicken nuggets. The sandwich looks like it was thrown together, way too much sauce. It was all over the entire sandwich and on the inside of the box that made the bread soggy. And to top it all off they gave me the head of lettuce and brown lettuce.,1,2,33.0093179,-97.2229254,Roanoke,United States,33.0093179 -97.2229254,tb_burgerking,2024-08-05 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

18246,Got the buttermilk chicken sandwich and not even sure if there was chicken. Bit untonit and had a cold grey semi solid mass caked in flavorless breading. Fries were soggy and unappealing. Usually no matter what Mcds you go to you expect some consistancy, with this one in Roanoke you can expect consistent bad food. Stay clear of this place.

18249,This McDonalds sucks. They recently had a remodel which means the inside is nice and they have the fancy double drive-thru, but unfortunately the remodel could not fix the main issue with this McDonalds: The management.

The management is either not training employees properly or teaching them to bend the rules to keep a good drive-thru timer, because you will always have to pull up at this McD's. Always. Even for perfectly reasonable orders at perfectly reasonable times (1 burger + fry at 3pm = pull up next to the 3-4 other cars already there).

The one manager I've had the displeasure of dealing with was rude as well. I had to go back due to them forgetting several items on an order (that I had to pull up and wait for more than 5 minutes for, no less) and decided I just wanted it refunded to my card. The manager was rude about refusing to put it back on the card and insisting on giving me cash. The best part? He made me pull up to get the cash.

So again: Mis-managed, terrible McDonalds. It's a franchise for a reason, this one just stinks.,2,2,33.0093179,-97.2229254,Roanoke,United States,33.0093179 -97.2229254,tb_burgerking,2024-12-11 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

19186,Number of times we've ordered from this McDonalds: 3
Number of times they've gotten the order right: 0

It cannot be spelled out any clearer. "Quarter pounder. Absolutely nothing on it. No cheese. Just the meat and the bun." It is so simple. Under normal circumstances I would stick around for them to get it right. But they have a steady supply of drugged out homeless people begging for money right there in the drive through line, so running that gauntlet a second time is downright dangerous.

So I get home to see if i can salvage this order. Pull the bun all the way off to start scraping fake cheese off of it. The stale, burned bun breaks (picture). I successfully scrape the cheese product off the top only to find there's another slice of fake cheese underneath the patty as well.

So I grab my food, go to this mcdonald's and show them my burger was pink. They proceed to apologise and gave me a new one, I ask for gloves so I may examine this one. I do and find that this burger is pink as well, so now this is 2 pink burgers in total given to me. I tell them, they go ahead and apologize and gives me another... And yes, you guessed it, a third pink burger!!!!!! So at this point of course I am very much disgusted and appalled by their lack attentiveness of the food they are distributing to the point I ask another customer next to me if he had seen what I did.... I didn't want to feel as if I was picking but he agreed, he saw pink, so I finally asked for a refund and fresh fries and left. I will not support this mcdonald's again!

Unlike this location that needs to hire more mature people and not you'd kids that are rude and always arguing .....,1,0,40.7719101,-74.1614754,Newark,United States,40.7719101 -74.1614754,tb_burgerking,2025-04-06 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885
19240,For the third day, I went to this McDonalds, which I frequently always come to this McDonalds, my daughter and my niece love McDonalds, so each time I place my order, I ask for a medium fries  with my additional order, and for the three days that I went, they were given me burnt fries.  I'm sorry but I paid a lot for my order to begin with, I'm not excepting burnt fries, especially three days in a row. Each time I asked for some new fries, and then they would give me good fries that were not burnt. Except for yesterday, I got my money back.  I ask the girl why was she giving me burnt fries, and her reply was that they didn't change the oil in which they cooked the fries in. The point is as a customer you don't have to keep excepting burnt fries, or anything that doesn't look right to you. You are already spending so much money to begin with ,to be getting burnt fries. Lately there's been lots of issues with this McDonalds, people have attitudes, don't have manners, they don't even say hi  or thank you for coming. I'll be taking my service elsewhere.

20282,I went in and ordered at a kiosk to go , I got a medium caramel frappe and a mcextreme bacon sandwich.
While waiting in line , I heard the kitchen staff say there is no sauce for the extreme, should we give it to them anyway? With no intentions of me hearing .
When my order came out, no one informed us there was no sauce , didnt ask us when making it if we still wanted it , another sandwich or my money back ..
I told them I heard them and they denied it , then said that they told someone else to let me know there was missing items for the sandwich . But she didnt , (I could hear them) and why would she make it without confirmation if she DID tell someone to ask ??
I also noticed there was 2 tomatoes instead of 3 that i paid extra for, same goes for the pickles I asked extra for .
I got a male employees attention and told him , hey this isn't correct...etc. he hot an attitude , rolled his eyes turned his back on me to continue what he was doing previously .
The only saving grace was a lady named Elyce , someone who I thought was a manager but she is only a crew member.
She intervened, corrected my order . The only one who helped . She deserves a raise// a reward . Thank you .

Also need more manpower too many customers and a very long wait time. And then you get you order now it has to be to go and it does not come with catsup for the fries, 2 napkins fires half way full etc etc. I will think twice before I go back to that restaurant. I really like McDonald's but having those experiences I might stop eating big mac's, fish sandwich, fries, sweet rolls and many other things.

There were 2 Mexicans ladies working the front and drive thru who seamed to be conversing and unbothered by THE customers in the lobby. The Mexican man in the back was the only one working hard.

20314,This is THE WORST MacDonald's I have ever visited. First thing I noticed. Four white customers standing in line and the black customers being served their meals. The BLACK manager custom made their sweet teas, reassured them that "all you have to do is ask for me and I'll ""have your back"". They left more than happy. Meanwhile the untrained cashier cannot prioritize drink expediting. When one of the white customers asked the manager to assist, the manager just looked at him and turned around. In response, that white customer left very angry before ordering. After witnessing this obvious display of racism towards whites, another white couple simply walked out without ordering. Finally I ordered my meal. A Big Mac meal. It took five minutes to expedite my meal. The black manager yelled out my number, dropped the bag that contained my meal on the counter and turned and left. No thank you, no reassurance that I was pleased, nothing. I then waited 10 MINUTES for my large Coke!!!!!!ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ The cashier, who is responsible for making drinks, didn't know how to get more ice or restock the large cups.

20324,042321 Tried them again in a rush and was insulted with a terrible attitude because I added a tea to my order, then she walked away with my credit card, the large cup had black finger prints marks on it, and gave me a scorched and cold egg Mcmuffin sandwich. The hashbrown was also greasy!

I ordered a bacon McGriddle w/o cheese, hash brown and a senior coffee. She thanked me and stated my cost. When it wasn't aligned with normal cost, I had to ask if I would do better ordering it as a meal. That reduced the price very nicely, but made me wonder why my server didn't at least offer to check the price to help me. Then, I decided if I'm paying for my cheese, I'll take it on the side. When I got my order, the bacon and the hash brown were just so loaded with grease! The sandwich was messier, sweet dough (yuk) and the hash brown soaked through the bag! I know McDonald's serves fast food, but this made me feel like a heart attack was going to happen if I ate it! I rarely stop at McD but I was running and hadn't eaten.

She opened the window and asked me with a attitude Did you just honk? And started going off on me about manners, by then i was so upset that i just told her just hand me my ranch i will not argue with you as she still was holding the ranch still going off I then told her are you kidding me just give me the ranch and explained to her since I pulled up to this window you have had a rude attitude but that was not my place to get upset over that if she was having a bad night I just wanted my order so I can get back to work, as I addressed her attitude she then said to me Why cause I'm black? I was so beyond upset I have never been talk to this way from any restaurant and really do not know what this girls deal was and how did it lead to her assuming it was about her being black.

20345,I stop here often only because it is on my way to and from work, but seriously this is by far consistently the worst McDonalds I have ever visited.  The milk shake machine is always broke down, as was tne case today.  I ordered a big mack, hold the catchup, fries and a diet coke. I even repeated myself to hold the catsup twice at the microphone and asked at the window again to insure she understood to hold the catsup on the burger and was meet with a very curt "yes, I heard you". Guess what , not only did they not hold the catsup but it was over loaded with extra catsup and I got a regular coke.  Well at least the fries were right.  I honestly believe the main problem is that the people taking orders at the drive thru speak poor English and obviously understand it equally as poorly, toped off with very poor customer service skills.

20393,I usually don't lower myself to Micky D's food, but I was here and hungry, so figured one burger from here wouldn't kill me. As long as your expectations aren't too high, the food is okay, just sad though what Micky D's and Burger King and the others have done to the Great American Hamburger. If you look around you can get better food and service. The only burgers worse than Micky Ds are the soy burgers you get out of vending machines. And as long as you don't ask for anything special, they'll make you a burger, but I asked for one without onions and catsup, and naturally they couldn't even get that right. A crappy burger with crappy service, what a wonderful meal..

She reluctantly agreed to make a new one a took my receipt.  20 minutes later still no burger. Went to the counter, a girl there gave the burger to someone else. Another burger was made, but they "lost" the receipt.  While standing at the counter waiting for a receipt to be reprinted, I was holding onto my bag. A man behind the counter tried to grab the bag out of my hand. I told him "hands off", he said he was checking the order number. TOTAL INCOMPETENCE!

22853,This McDonald's is way more efficient than the other McDonald's down by  Animal Kingdom with the drive thru they are also a lot more friendlier at least on the intercom. But they didn't cook my quarter pounder to temp because it was still red on the inside of the meat which was disgusting. I had to go to the door in order to get my burger fixed which then I ran into the situation of them starting to close their doors 5 minutes before they were supposed to close at 12 and the employee looked at me and said we are closed when I literally was holding the burger in my hand to show for proof. I look at the employee and say I know I came up here because I had just ordered from the drive thru this burger and it isn't cooked all the way. She takes the burger doesn't say anything and shuts the door with me standing outside. I then wait thank gosh she came back with a new one I didn't know if she was going to.

22872,Companies need to understand it's not 2020 anymore. The public is tired of your excuses. Be aware this location starts breakfast at 4am however during late hours they shut their systems down meaning they only take cash, and mobile orders are not accepted, and the mobile app is not updated to make yiuu aware of this. Maybe it's legit, seems shady though. If anything it is poor management. It is understandable to shut down system during slower times if need be.

22943,This McDonald's usually ROCKS!
They can get thru a line that goes all the way to the highway in under 20 min.

Tonight,  there was no line. Also the inside was closed. AND...  THE ICE CREAM MACHINE WAS BROKEN/SHUT OFF. SHOCKER.

My son did something amazing at school and wanted a Sunday for a treat. So thats why we went.

Then they didn't put all the things we ordered in the bag and we drove off. 2 u turns in traffic and waiting in line now to get what they forgot.
So... I asked the manager if they could just add a small bag of fries since we had to do 2 uturns to get this item they forgot to put in the bag. She said No, we can't do that.
REALLY!?!?!?! I have worked in the food industry for 28 years.  I am well aware of what you can and can not do.
You didn't WANT TO. You didn't want to value me as a person, a customer,  or a future. You didn't want to do your job properly in the 1st place. You didn't want to apologize in any way shape or form.

I don't mind that a mistake was made. I do mind that they acted like it was my fault for ordering anything to begin with.

After I couldn't make the order I was standing at the line and the employee said all orders needed to be thru the Kiosk. I told them I tried it and was unable to complete the order and I prefer (wanted) to do it thru cashier. Manager Jennifer was rude and said that if I wanted to do it with a cashier I had to do it via drive thru. To be honest, that is totally disrespectful and unprofessional. Where is the customer service or Customer Service satisfaction?? You can not force your customers to do only kiosk!!!! What about people that can't read???

Pros: any location Im at from Shenzhen China to Hawaii to Orlando I can count on McDonalds when I land. They keep the same consistent taste world wide. as a business owner this is admirable. This location was efficient and fast.

Cons: we all know it's not the healthiest food but that had nothing to do with the location
So I only ate it once on my 5 day stay.
McDonald's should explore healthier options for the current market . But still a great experience

10 out of 10.

23017,I felt so bad about how crazy busy they were that I wanted to jump behind the counter and help hand out bags! They did the best they could considering how hectic it was... and it was 11pm. It was pretty cool to see the kiosk that you can order from. Much rather order my food through that than a person.,3,2,28.3335081,-81.5137384,Kissimmee,United States,28.3335081 -81.5137384,tb_burgerking,2024-11-01 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885
23022,I want to apologize to anyone that I recommended this particular McDonald's to in the past.
This was the restaurant that I used to recommend to tourists when they were looking for a fast place to eat that was away from the Disney parks, but still close enough to get back to the parks quickly. At that time, it was worth it. The menu was cheap (or at least what you know to expect from a international chain) and, since it's a chain, you know what the food is gong to be like.
So, let's look at what you need to do if you are a member of a chain of restaurants. You need to set yourself apart with your service. This WAS the reason I used to recommend this restaurant. Sadly, I don't think they care anymore. The last time we went, half of the kiosks weren't working. One of the three that was, didn't print receipts. (This plays a part into why the service was so atrocious. Actually there was a lot that played into it.) Now, if you've gone to McDonald's at all recently, you know you pick your food at the kiosk, get a number that you take to your table, pay at the kiosk, sit down and wait for your food. Typically all of that takes about five minutes. Well, this day (and what I've garnered from tourists and locals, on many other days) the team at work decided they weren't going to bring the food to the table. That would have been fine if there was any indication ANYWHERE, but of course that would have been a form of service so that didn't happen. After about 15 minutes of trying to find a place where we could all sit together (only a slight exaggeration) we were told by other customers that were leaving that they weren't calling numbers and you had to wait at the counters.
Ok... So I go up to the counter and wait. We get our food 40 minutes later, and there were the obligatory mess ups that we had to get corrected. No big deal, we are used to this.
My in-laws are visiting and at this point I'm trying to figure why they haven't received their order. It dawned on me  that my father in-law doesn't have a receipt (remember the machine that wasn't printing receipts?).
The person calling numbers is calling the number on the receipt, not the tent number. Apparently, my in-laws food was ready in a master of minutes (amazing since that is all customized) and placed in the "abandoned order" area. If we hadn't said anything, they would never have received their food. The lady never once called a tent number. We told another person of the lack of receipt problem. That information never got transmitted to the person calling the numbers. When we spoke with her and told her their was no receipt, she asked us what the receipt number was. We had the tent card in hand and pointed at the receipt plastered on the ice cream machine, and she asked again for the receipt.
Aside from the travesty that was the most important thing a restaurant is to do, the place looked like a slightly cleaned up version of a break room at a local dump. I'm not sure if they just didn't staff well on this shift, but like I said, I've talked to a few tourists and locals and they all say it had been this way a while.,1,2,28.3335081,-81.5137384,Kissimmee,United States,28.3335081 -81.5137384,tb_burgerking,2024-11-30 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885
23037,Unnecessary long wait time in drive thru. Drive thru is built for double cars and double pick up windows but still stayed behind 4 cars for 30 minutes. Only waited due to long drive home with kids in the car. Rude staff as well. Really wish I had noticed the Burger King across the street earlier. I would have even settled for checkers across the street and that's saying a lot because I don't think anyone willingly eats at checkers,1,2,28.3335081,-81.5137384,Kissimmee,United States,28.3335081 -81.5137384,tb_burgerking,2024-10-11 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885
23038,McDonald's is ok. I just wish they wouldn't pester people in leaving while the kids are playing in the play place. I mean I get the no loitering, but we bought food, and kids are just trying to play and they didn't really finish their own good. They just wanted to enjoy the empty play area,3,2,28.3335081,-81.5137384,Kissimmee,United States,28.3335081 -81.5137384,tb_burgerking,2025-03-29 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885
23040,Extremely rude and impatient. I asked for 3 water cups with my 40$ meal and I got a glare and only one cup.  Then my brother who ordered a 20 piece nugget went up to ask for sauce because they didn't include any that we asked for, after waiting patiently and then asking several times he got 2 of the 4 he asked for.  He came back frustrated with only 2 so I told him to go back for more. He asked the manager 4 times to her face very nicely for 2 more and she just looked at him each time and went the other way. Eventually a kind fellow customer next to him reached over the counter and just took sauce for my brother. Not impressed,1,2,28.3335081,-81.5137384,Kissimmee,United States,28.3335081 -81.5137384,tb_burgerking,2025-03-24 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885
23044,Worst customer service ever!! I was invited to come in after having to wait over 45 minutes on the drive thru. Manager Priscilla calls me to apologize and invites me back with my family, I explained I cannot come back next day, but would come following Sunday, she agreed and hung up. On Sunday I come to the restaurant and there is another manager Cynthia who I explained the situation and she grunted the whole time she took the order. While on the service line, she tries to contact the manager and right there from behind the line, she asks me yelling, what is your name, I tell her and again in front of EVERYONE, other customers included, yells again, "she tells me you came in already!!" I replied NO, at this point I'm embarrassed and upset and I hear her that she tells the person on the phone I already put it down. Twenty minutes later, I finally get the order. I ask her to change the fries on some of the things that were ready because they were cold. The manager grunts and agrees to. After my family were done with their meals, we had ordered ice cream and we asked to hold off until we were done. When we returned, we asked for the ice cream and we had asked for chocolate, they said that we had ordered vanilla and the manager gave us one less of what we ordered. Incredible! Bottom line, we were invited to come back to make it up for bad service and McDonald's came through, we got yelled at by the manager, embarrased, long wait for food, missing food items, and pissy attitude by staff. Next time I get invited back I guess I gotta read the fine print or ask for what am I invited to come back for.

23052,Just stopped by my local McDonald's to pick up some breakfast items before going to work. The 78th Street Tampa Florida branch is always on their mark, quick efficient usually correct with my order of hot tasty food. I can't believe how much I've been eating at McDonald's the last 3 years after many many years of barely ever going there since I was a teenager in the 1970s. Food is definitely better than it used to be, and I love getting deals with their online phone app and food questionnaires for freebies from the receipts.,4,2,28.3335081,-81.5137384,Kissimmee,United States,28.3335081 -81.5137384,tb_burgerking,2025-04-30 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885
23058,Excellent location with a large playground and plenty of seating for adults. The food is your typical McDonald's fare with nothing special to write about. They have a large parking lot, and the bathrooms were clean during my visit. My only recommendation would be for the managers and employees to meet up behind the restaurant or in the break room instead of right in front of one of the main doors of the restaurant. It made the place look like a corner store and cheapens the image of this brand. Their service was top notch and although they were packed during this visit the food came out fresh and without any delays.,4,0,28.3335081,-81.5137384,Kissimmee,United States,28.3335081 -81.5137384,tb_burgerking,2024-11-17 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

23066,They had a broken latte machine.  The kiosk already had our CC deposit.  It took very long to receive our CC refund because the manager had to perform the business, and the restaurant was overly crowded.

One sauce dispensor just explodes pop knocks the container out of my hand under strong pressure. Gets little sauce on my clothes, not too bad but Jesus Christ...

Only pro here was that I got what I actually ordered however what a game trying to order it.

She was ruder then my explicit Eminem album and when I finally got to sorting out my order it was awful.. My chicken nuggets tasted like chewing on the chickens feet fresh out of the pen.
My Apple pie was questionable to if it was even a pie or not.
They only gave me bbq sauces, like who doesn't want ketchup ???

Because they mixed fresh fries with fries that wrre sitting out basically old kinda stale. The milkshake had vanilla at the bottom with Strawberry on top. But that nits what kinda upset me it was the size of the shake. I was asked what size I wanted. Of course I was confused. I guess all McDonald's are not the same. I said small. But the cup I received was a cup size you order off the dollar menu. And I was charged like 5 bucks for it. Smh. Never again. I thought shake size was only small or large.

I order the same thing. Well its not fresh, its called "to order". I had to wait , no issues with that, if you want fresh food you typically have to wait for it to be made.  I got my food 8 minutes later and drove off so I could get the food to the house. Almost home, I look in the bag and grab a fry, because mcdonalds fries fresh are freaking delicious. Yeah no, I bit 5 fries all at once and they were soggy and unsalted. Highly disappointed. I tried to call and the phone just rang. I was no longer close to the mcdonalds so I just ordered the same thing at another mcdonalds closer to my destination in winter park.

Shrink-flation at its best.  Half filled fries. Soda with no refills. Seriously? Especially now that a combo meal costs $9.

24131,We were inside a Walmart McDonald's. My granddaughter has food allergies to egg & dairy. So there are only a few things that she can have. We had ordered her a kids happy meal with apple slices but they gave us french fries instead. The beef frying oil has dairy in it so she can not have the french fries and they were all out of apple slices. Next we ordered apple juice. They were all out of apple juice as well. The girl employee that was trying to help us did not believe me that the french fries had dairy in it. A happy meal hamburger and apple slices is all she can have here. Was not happy with the service here.

Right next to me a customer brought up a buttermilk crispy chicken that got everything on it except for the chicken. After receiving my order McDonald's employee I was telling waiting customers to use the touch screen, One customer said she didn't know how to use it so she was told by the McDonald's employee to continue to wait.

The manager refused to refund my order and also refused to give me her name. The manager that works there during the night should not be in management and lacks customer service skills along with the other 3 employees that refused to acknowledge us at the drive thru window.

The young man who took my order was kind,  that was the first window.  2nd window,  a whole other story.  Drive up, and right off the bat, this young lady looks mad that she is even working.  You know,  at least fake that you are Blessed to even have a job.  I was scared to ask her for a cup holder, but I did any way,  lol.  I had the BigMac Meal and remember like I said I had not been in forever.... I DEVOURED THAT BIG MAC, it Was fresh, and so were the fries. I also had a Fish sandwich.

Staffing issues really not helping this location live up to the "Fast Food" label.
From order to recieving the food, it took 42mins, and even then the order came out wrong.
There was one manager, one fry cook and one burger cook, trying to complete a dinner time rush, yet there were 3 cleaning staff going round cleaning 1 table every 20mins or so.
This team could really do with some logistical training on how to get orders out efficiently and on time, because this really was a poor attempt at "fast food".,1,2,28.4238144,-81.4612421,Orlando,United States,28.4238144 -81.4612421,tb_burgerking,2024-09-21 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

Turns out the order had been completed but staff were 'busy with other dutys'; so it just sat there. So much for customer service. However, the shift leader did apologize. Honestly, I'd rather have hot food. And once in my vehicle, I discovered the order was not even correct. Failure level = complete.

24375,They certainly need to take a look at the way they are staffing the night shift.

24384,Service at this place is a joke. Sat in the drive threw for 20 minutes waiting of my food. The tea is bad 60 percent of the time. I believe this falls directly on management. As there are always new employees there. Most times having poor attitudes. Also I have never once been suggested a pie. I don't even bother pointing it out as it would only take longer. And probably be un edible. I only stop in there maybe once a month when I'm in a bind.,1,2,28.4238144,-81.4612421,Orlando,United States,28.4238144 -81.4612421,tb_burgerking,2025-04-01 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885
24385,I came here on my way to a meeting in the convention center. I had 20 minutes to be where I needed to be so I figured I would swing by this McDonald's and grab some food. Boy was that a mistake. I arrived at this McDonald's at 11:45. I did not order my food at the drive-thru window until 10 minutes after 12:00. By the time I actually got my food it was closer to 12:30. This has to be the absolute slowest McDonald's in the history of any restaurant in the world. It has double drive throughs and they seem to prefer the inside Lane to the outside lane. They were taking the orders of customers on the inside line too if not three to one. Not exactly sure what was going on inside the building. But they were slower than molasses. I understand that there is issues right now with finding employees for a little bit of prep work would have sped up the process a little bit. That's why I gave them three stars instead of one.,3,2,28.4238144,-81.4612421,Orlando,United States,28.4238144 -81.4612421,tb_burgerking,2024-05-18 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

24387,I'll start with the positive: The food I received was the correct order and it was hot. The bad: What was supposed to be a 10 minute trip ended up being almost 40 because they were severely understaffed, and constantly giving out the wrong food to everyone.

24397,I would give 3.5 stars for the sugar free caramel iced coffee and 1 star for the sausage burritos. The burritos were very small half the normal size and very little filling or cheese inside. It's been a year since I had a sausage burrito and McDonald's has definitely gone downhill. Prices are higher for the burrito and you get less food for the money.,2,2,28.4238144,-81.4612421,Orlando,United States,28.4238144 -81.4612421,tb_burgerking,2024-05-18 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

Service treats you like you are a problem for them, ie: the server placed the food on front of the customer and started to walk off, the customer said what about my drink.  The server rolled her eyes walked away, brought the drink back reached through the screen put the drink down and walked away.  No I am sorry, no have a nice day.

24448,Another experience.

I was asked to wait at drive thru. No other customers were in queue. They forgot about me. The order was reduced without telling me. The apple pies were removed without any explanation. When I called to report the issue a woman who answered the phone saying she was the manager didn't identify herself. She was rude and short and when I asked for her name she wouldn't provide it. Bad experience with the food too. The fries were so over salted I couldn't eat them and the big mac had so much lettuce and sauce on it I was wondering what happened in the kitchen. End to end bad experience.

Hello I came to your restaurant this morning and waited an extremely long time and was ignored by your staff. I waited at the drive thru order kiosk, then at the payment window and then at the pick up window. Your staff saw me waiting making eye contact several times but continuing to ignore me. I moved back to the payment window and waited while several cars pulled up waiting too. When Mitzy who had ignored me finally opened the window was really dismissive with her demeanor before taking my order. I asked why she saw me and continued to make me wait. Her response was I just put on the headset. Seriously that was her response. There were at least four of the staff who saw me so I am really frustrated with your customer service. Why didn't she acknowledge that she kept me waiting and just apologized for the delay like a normal person. I was really offended that she was so flippant when I asked her about making me wait. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE and lack of basic human kindness. NOT LOVING IT.

Visited again on 3/17/2018 and had the same experience. Even the white shirt manager ignored me.,1,2,28.4238144,-81.4612421,Orlando,United States,28.4238144 -81.4612421,tb_burgerking,2024-06-10 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

24513,Sat in the drive thru for 30 minutes before being able to order. Part of the delay was due to another car deciding thier time was more valuable by cutting the line so it pushed three other cars besides mine back in line. Two other cars followed suit so we couldn't even leave when we wanted to and were forced to stay and order because we along with the traffic trying to leave the parking lot was blocked in.

24519,Good luck being served if you have questions about allergies. We asked one of the employees to check the ingredients of the chicken nuggets to make sure there were no dairy allergens. He asked his manager to check. She straight out refused. We couldn't even complete one of our orders.

30 minutes after placing our other order, we received fries so cold, when I went up to the front to get fresh ones, I didn't even have to say anything. One of the employees brought me new ones automatically after the manager ignored my presence.

The bathrooms were nasty, the tables were dirty, every trash can was over flowing, and the whole lobby smelled like rotten fish.

The staff is not friendly not greeting when you walk in the door they have no idea what the 3' ruled is. Whoever their trainer is should be ashame when they have the McDonald's conference in Orlando Florida. If I could give them negative stars I would. When you go through the drive-through there is not a proper greeting. It as is if you are bothering the attendant taking your order. There is no quality service.

I told him this was the 2nd time in a month I had to wait an outrageous time for fast food and he just starred at me blankly. Eventually Daniel told me I was holding him up and making other people wait. I thought that was pretty rude and unconstructive for a manager to say.

24603,This has to be the WORST experience ever at a fast food place. We used the kiosk and were thrilled because we placed the order faster than the workers that were ignoring us at the counter. THEN they only brought 1/4 of our order. Forgot our 4 McCafe drinks and condiments. Then when one of the teenagers told someone at the counter, he was told to ask someone else. Really? You want $15/hr for this?

24607,I would rate it a 1 star but people would not take my review seriously. I visited this restaurant last night. It was very clean including the bathroom. At this time there was one cashier with a huge line and a bunch of people waiting for their order. The cashier was overloaded and the manager told everyone to order at the kiosks and not the register. This wasn't possible because nobody could pay at the kiosk; they had to get a receipt and pay at the register. I left 20 minutes later and went to Wendy's when the line had barely moved.,2,2,28.4238144,-81.4612421,Orlando,United States,28.4238144 -81.4612421,tb_burgerking,2025-03-26 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885
24615,New system of ordering at kiosks is aweful. Despite the most important thing to me being wanting to order with a human being, ordering at the kiosk took longer and was more difficult than ordering with a human...and I wanted to pay cash which required I go to a cashier after ordering at the kiosk, very frustrating. Also, the new fountain drink machines are equally aweful, I will never order a drink from a machine that dispenses all drinks from one spout because no matter what you dispense it always tastes like a mix of more than one drink. Why has McDonalds chosen to fix what wasn't broken and use systems and machines which customers so clearly dislike?,2,2,28.4238144,-81.4612421,Orlando,United States,28.4238144 -81.4612421,tb_burgerking,2024-09-28 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

24681,For a prime, busy, tourist filled location, the processes and procedures at this McDonalds are absolutely terrible.  Many of the self-ordering machines do not work, when you use a normal line with a cashier, it's like the employees have never even been to a McDonald's before as they don't even know the menu items (I ordered traditional chicken nuggets meal, so it wasn't pasta, or some sandwich that only special locations have).  When you order at a kiosk, you can order things they do not have such as a waffle cone ice cream.  Then you wait 15+ minutes to find out they don't have waffle cones and wait for an employee to make a fresh one, which she doesn't know how to do so you end up paying $4+ for a cup of ice cream.  I did get my money back for the ice cream because I couldn't believe it took that long.

25312,This location is near the city Zoo. It is beautifully themed with majestic animals. We enjoyed that they made the interior a learning environment. The service was good too, which was very refreshing.

This location features a play area as well. Our orders were correct. That is miraculous considering the multiple errors we normally see when placing fast food orders.

25317,We usually always go before the zoo because it was cutely decorated to the zoo theme and the kids enjoy the experience. Service has always been meh but the atmosphere made up for it. Now it's just a boring, modern McDonald's with bleh service. The remodel was a mistake and if you're going to take away the only appealing part of the place at least make sure the service improves. Probably won't come back during our zoo trips anymore. ï¿½ï,1,2,32.7445961,-96.8122859,Dallas,United States,32.7445961 -96.8122859,tb_burgerking,2024-06-12 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

25360,The App let's you order breakfast and pay ahead, but when you show up and it's 10:03, their system won't let them complete your order.

The location is relatively good, the employees are always friend and fast.

But someone needs to pass along yo the corporate office/app devs and need to either decide to

1) prepare prepaid breakfast orders and have them ready before the 10:00 shut off, or

2) allow them to prepare my prepaid breakfast order 3 minutes after "it's no longer breakfast time"

I do not want to eat a burger as my first meal of the day at 10:03 on the way to work.,1,0,32.7445961,-96.8122859,Dallas,United States,32.7445961 -96.8122859,tb_burgerking,2025-02-11 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

Some days you'll sit at the drive through line for a long time then get told to wait in a parking spot. Whoever owns this franchise should be proud of it and maintain it's quality that it had.

25453,My wife and I was going to this McDonald's for some morning when they had another crew. But here recently they changed the morning to a new crew(an old man, a young vanity lady at the drive through window that is very rude). This crew need to be removed. They never seemed to know how to work and prepare your order in a timely manner. This facility is also made where you can't just get out of line in the drive through which is very dangerous if a car stalls or a real emergency arrives. We will be skipping visiting the morning crew.

I said that I put my order in through the app. They said that because their system was down they could not give me the food that I paid for. I spent ten dollars and wasted a half hour of my life. I have had to complain to corporate, I have had to talk to a manager via email. Nothing has been done, they don't even want to give me a refund they merely offered me a coupon which they never gave me. It has been months since this had happened and there is still no resolution. If I left a McDonald's with ten dollars worth of food they would have me arrested but because I am a customer they are fine with stealing my money and my time.

25925,I never leave reviews but I had to here.

Honestly, if you visited every single McDonalds in the country and ranked them I am convinced this one would be dead last.

I spent an hour in the drive-thru and when I got to the window it took 10 minutes before anyone even came to the window and when they did they had no idea what I had ordered.

I have never seen a group of people move so slowly and with such little purpose or interest  in what they were doing. It seems like they were just annoyed to be working at all. Literally it looked like the whole crew was moving in slow motion, it was a sight to see.

Then when I finally did get my food the order it was, of course, not correct. But the weird thing is they didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t short me they gave me an extra quarter pounder and fries.

This is supposed to be fast food.

When I went to pick up my order, the drinks were wrong, the potatoes were the wrong size and old, the Sundae machine was broken, they didn't deliver our sundaes and the attendance was super rude, saying that the problem was mine and not hers, burgers were in the correct Double Quarter Ponder box but when we got home, there were cheeseburgers and the third burger wasnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t in the bag!!

25964,Biscayne Blvd., and 35th Street
Based upon what I observed and experienced at the drive-thru window with 4 employees (one who couldn't even understand or speak English), I made a complaint to McDonald's yesterday and will wait to hear from someone with the franchise owner's organization.  The owner needs to know how poorly managed this restaurant is, and how inadequately the employees are trained to do their jobs.  I also have contacted and submitted a written complaint to Chris Kempczinski, CEO of McDonald's, as well as Steve Easterbrook who is the President and Chief Executive Officer of McDonald's in Chicago.  They need to understand why McDonald's is doing so poorly; afterall, when they have to communicate to their Board members and investors about a drop in multiple quarterly revenues and earnings over the past year, maybe then they will take a look at how poorly they select, train and manage their employees to create a positive customer experience with stellar service. I will not be going to this, or any other, McDonald's again!  It was that bad.  McDonald's corporation needs to do a thorough investigation of how this restaurant is NOT being properly managed by the franchise owner and managers.  The owner clearly must put numbers before people.  Horrible, horrible experience!  Will stick with Wendy's instead.  They have much better food and service!

26327,If we focus too much on ourselves and the troubles in our lives, it is very difficult to be happy. Lord, refresh my spirit, help me let go of longing to become something I am not and show me how to be the best of who I am.
Open your mind and empty your heart of fears so that you can know and experience God to the fullest. Lord, You are my peace, my assurance and the love that I hold on to.Reach higher than you think possible for all that you want and you find that often you attain even more. Lord, I rely on Your promises made to each of us and especially on Your love.
Be patient with others, but mostly be patient with yourself. Lord, help me to keep a smile on my face and to realize my goodness and refuse to dwell on my imperfections.Desiring more and more without appreciating what you have right now will never allow you to be truly happy. Be grateful for the gifts you are receiving right this very minute. That's happiness!God gives abundantly to those who pass His gifts on to others. Lord, let Your blessings flow in to me and then out from me. I will neither be selfish nor let my gifts stagnate.
Use Jesus' as your example on how to live. Lord, You will guide and advise us and then You will leave it to us to decide our own future. Give us wisdom in our choices.Dear Lord, thank you for being such a loving God and caring about our pain. You don't want to see us suffer. You know the suffering that we face, and I ask that you would please redeem it and bring it to an end. In the midst, Lord, I believe that you are sufficient.

26360,They always have a lot of staff in hand, specially on the week ends and at peak hours. You will always see a lot of tourist due to the perfect location near the shopping and the pier. This also means that there will be homeless there as well. I like to live and let live so I don't mind sharing space with my fellow man. With that said there is security at hand at all times.

26373,Manager sucks. I called her over for help and she ignored me. Seating arrangements are disorganized. The soda fountain machine is always dirty. Hardly any ice.

26374,Worst McDonald's in the world, that's a big statement but its the only one that fits.
I ordered breakfast on a Saturday. It wasn't too busy but when I got my food I was missing some sandwiches, my pancakes were super cold like if they had just defrosted them and put them in my bag and the hashbrowns were literally stuck to the wrapper and the bag they came in looked like it had been dunked in the deep frier.

Save your money, go eat somewhere else where the food is actually edible.
To clarify I'm not bagging on all McDonald's, I quite like the food BUT this location is terrible, my suggestion is to go elsewhere,1,2,34.0122192,-118.4945396,Santa Monica,United States,34.0122192 -118.4945396,tb_burgerking,2024-09-01 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

26395,Go anywhere else. Not here. Beyond the counter, this place is never clean.  Glorified truck stop.  Too many other options, next door and, nearby that are more deserving of your business. Especially, since the "dining room" is no longer open 24 hours.  No drive through. Sad. Literally, steps from the pier. The collective grime of all of Santa Monica resides on this location surrounding sidewalks. The homeless aren't the issue.  It is the mentally disturbed , the hustlers  and questionable addicts. This is not a family friendly location.  Wisely most families recognize this and steer clear.  These truths sometimes slip pass the trained smiles of the cashiers and you see the weariness and defeat.  No other business has these issues!  Not one.  Food?

The prices were so reasonable, $25 was more than enough chips to play for as long as we wanted.

I liked the food a lot. I had heard of the location having pizza and pasta so I got both. I also got a large fries a burger and drinks. Me and my party enjoyed the food and honestly the pizza was in some ways better than other pizza places.

Only con:
I'd recommend going through the drive through and not getting the special items only because the wait when you order pizza or pasta is increasing fast.

26580,What can I say, it's McDonalds.  The food is never cold or smashed. It's hit or miss on the type of employee you'll get at the drive through. They either "don't want to be here and hate the fact that you're making them work" or they "smile and make you feel welcomed". It's close to my office for a quick breakfast or lunch.

I'm editing my last post and changing my rating. I waited in the Drive-Thru for 10 minutes with no one coming on the line. The other line however three cars went through while I sat there. I pulled forward to place my order at the window and I was told that I had to drive back around. The level of unacceptable is insane.

26631,This is one of the best McDonalds I have been to. They were closed for several months due to construction. The great food and service has made up for the time when they were not operational. The food is always hot and the Buns so far have been fresh and soft. The best thing about McDonald's are the FRIES!!!!  Their fries are always fresh, hot, and delicious. The best part is they stand straight up in the box just as they do on the commercials and pictures. I don't mind waiting in the sometimes long drive-thru line for fresh food.

It is supposed to be the most modern of Equipment and yet it was the slowest experience I have ever had at a McDonald's, and only for two egg McMuffins.  Then, the English muffin was burnt on both sandwiches.  The staff definitely did not want to be there.  It is my closest McDonald's but I will definitely be driving the longer distance next time.

I always check my food right then and there because this location usually messes up drive though orders , and  when I showed them  the employee gave me a attitude and rolled their eyes at me .

She then said I had to pull out of the drive through to wait for my order to be fixed it would be 5 to 10 minutes, since my lunch is only 30 minutes, I had no choice but to leave.,1,2,34.1525074,-118.3679036,North Hollywood,United States,34.1525074 -118.3679036,tb_burgerking,2024-10-03 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885
26697,This location should have stayed closed. Why do they have a re-opening sign when they're only operating for drive thru. What about the pedestrians? The ones who can't drive? At least I was able to walk in and  order food before they remodeled. I live less than a mile from here and I can't walk over and physically order food? And why is there a parking lot if we can't walk in. And how rude the associate was that I basically should have known better that they were only running the drive thru? You're better off going to the one on burbank Blvd. Who puts a double lane on a drive thru and doesn't expect problems?

"ok I'll punch it in so it comes out a good deal for you."

Um... Ok...

When I got the order it ONLY had egg. I politely informed the person at the drive through window, but they refused to correct the order, saying in a absolute terms that this is what I ordered and if I wanted what I ACTUALLY ordered I'd have to get back in line and place a new order!!

26722,Every time I've eaten there I've never seen an employee clean or wipe down a table.  Always sticky and I've had  to use water and napkins to clean the tables before eating.  I'd think they would at least watch and take care of this situation.   Also, very drafty from AC over tables and if you want to have warm food eat fast.   I've asked if they could turn the AC down a bit, but they said they couldn't.

26725,Beware of the parking, it is very crowded and the drive through is inconveniently located  very closely to row of cars backing up and when gets crowded, if you are backing up you may have to wait or  even worse get hit by a car backing up (I actually saw this).  Not a big fan of McDonalds food, but the fries are classic and a tea no sugar is refreshing.  My order is always small fries and large tea no sugar.

26728,I was there this morning at 10:00 a.m., thinking about ordering breakfast and coffee. The woman on the intercom wasn't really friendly and did not explain to me why they were not serving breakfast at this time. I thought breakfast was served throughout the day no matter what but I guess I was wrong. I've never had an issue with this McDonald's but this was a first and disappointing,1,2,34.1525074,-118.3679036,North Hollywood,United States,34.1525074 -118.3679036,tb_burgerking,2024-10-11 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885
26740,It took several minutes for someone to take our order, then our order took forever and was wrong. My Mc muffin was rock hard and instead of the cheeseburger my friend ordered he received a Mc chicken with cheese. they were out of sweet tea and the little straw trash bin on the soda fountain was bursting out and spilling into the ice catch. This facility is dirty, packed both inside and in the drive thru, and is obviously understaffed.,1,2,34.1525074,-118.3679036,North Hollywood,United States,34.1525074 -118.3679036,tb_burgerking,2024-11-20 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885
26741,They got my order wrong... This happens often.

To make things worse they are very inefficient. Ordered a small fries, they served 10 other people before I got mine. Seriously, fill up a small bag with fries while you await other order burgers. I used to worl at McDonalds 10 years ago and know how it should be run. Horrible!

Ironically two other individuals complained about their order while I waited and one got into an argument with the manager over cold cheese.,1,2,34.1525074,-118.3679036,North Hollywood,United States,34.1525074 -118.3679036,tb_burgerking,2024-05-13 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885
26742,The drive through at this McDonald's has always been busy every time I've gone.  It's honestly worth driving a little extra to another location if you are in a hurry.  I've been stuck in the drive thru line for over 15 minutes on several occasions just ordering a single cheeseburger.  Granted, compared to In and Out that's nothing, but this is McDonalds.  That aside, the interior has always been pretty clean when I've went inside.  If you go for breakfast on the weekends, once again, be prepared to wait.  They do take Apple Pay and Android pay!  The one time I used it, the person behind the counter actually knew what it was.  So many places tell you they don't have it but just don't know what it is.  Another big plus is the drive through is 24 hours.,2,2,34.1525074,-118.3679036,North Hollywood,United States,34.1525074 -118.3679036,tb_burgerking,2024-07-02 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885
26747,I ordered a Mcdouble, which was on their outside drive thru menu. When it came up on the order screen it was shown as a Bacon Mcdouble, I told them that I just wanted the regular Mcdouble, no bacon. So all they did was note NO Bacon, and still charged me the full price for a Bacon Mcdouble. When I got to the window I clarified again, but was told they didn't have that in their system, and that I had to pay the full price for the Bacon Mcdouble. I asked ro talk to the manager who then told me they didn't have what I ordered. I told him to go out and check his menu, because it was on there. He told me he didn't need to, that it was not on the menu. He was very rude and dismissive. I realize it is just a few cents difference, but why should anyone pay for something they didn't order, especially if what you ordered is on the menu. I see no reason to be treated so unprofessionally, and rudely. I don't recommend visiting this McDonalds, luckily there are plenty of others near by who treat people with respect.,1,0,34.1525074,-118.3679036,North Hollywood,United States,34.1525074 -118.3679036,tb_burgerking,2024-10-13 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

27436,This restaurant had an nice increase in customer service once new management took over (at least I think it was new MGMT), and a remodel. Now, however, they seem to be sliding back into giving constant wrong orders, not giving there sauces that they make you ask for (don't forget to ask for ketchup at the window, since they don't seem to want to take that part at the speaker).  We are back into driving to the Southlake location to give them it money since they rarely get our order wrong.

27455,Very disappointed with this McDonald's! I ordered a crispy buttermilk chicken sandwich meal and supersize my order when I drove uo to the window I paid my total and then I sat there waiting for about 5 minutes so I said to myself maybe they're cooking a fresh chicken so I didn't mind the wait. Well when I got home I took the first bite on the sandwich and let me tell you THAT CHICKEN HAD BEEN SEATING ON THE HEAT PAN FOR A VERY LONG TIME BECAUSE IT WAS LITERALLY HARD LIKE A ROCK AND IT WAS NOT JUICY AT ALL IT WAS VERY DRY! and then the fries that I got were overcooked every single one of them were burnt!,1,2,33.0093179,-97.2229254,Roanoke,United States,33.0093179 -97.2229254,tb_burgerking,2024-07-20 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885
27440,This McDonalds sucks. They recently had a remodel which means the inside is nice and they have the fancy double drive-thru, but unfortunately the remodel could not fix the main issue with this McDonalds: The management.

The management is either not training employees properly or teaching them to bend the rules to keep a good drive-thru timer, because you will always have to pull up at this McD's. Always. Even for perfectly reasonable orders at perfectly reasonable times (1 burger + fry at 3pm = pull up next to the 3-4 other cars already there).

The one manager I've had the displeasure of dealing with was rude as well. I had to go back due to them forgetting several items on an order (that I had to pull up and wait for more than 5 minutes for, no less) and decided I just wanted it refunded to my card. The manager was rude about refusing to put it back on the card and insisting on giving me cash. The best part? He made me pull up to get the cash.

So again: Mis-managed, terrible McDonalds. It's a franchise for a reason, this one just stinks.,2,2,33.0093179,-97.2229254,Roanoke,United States,33.0093179 -97.2229254,tb_burgerking,2024-12-02 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

Then after I clarify what I ordered again I get a Dr pepper instead of a Coke and then grape instead of strawberry. This is a everyday occurrence when she is working the drive-thru window.

My husband ordered 2 large fries, 2 PLAIN McChickens, and 2 large drinks.....The drinks were great.....the rest was not even what he ordered and OLD. In the bag was a fillet o fish (which to my surprise was the only fresh thing), 2 medium 5 year old fries, and 2- 10 year old cheeseburgers...seriously, the cheeseburgers were so old the cheese was crusting. Where is the quality????? They don't care if people are upset and/or get food poisoning?? Granted my husband should have checked the bag before leaving, but he didn't think to (not surprised). I was definitely upset the order was wrong and said whatever and we were going to eat it because we basically got smaller fries, but an extra sandwich, but those CHEESEBURGERS were so horrendous that whoever put that order together should be fired because it was just wrong..meat and cheese was well past shelf life and the pics I upload will show it.

27550,Number of times we've ordered from this McDonalds: 3
Number of times they've gotten the order right: 0

It cannot be spelled out any clearer. "Quarter pounder. Absolutely nothing on it. No cheese. Just the meat and the bun." It is so simple. Under normal circumstances I would stick around for them to get it right. But they have a steady supply of drugged out homeless people begging for money right there in the drive through line, so running that gauntlet a second time is downright dangerous.

So I get home to see if i can salvage this order. Pull the bun all the way off to start scraping fake cheese off of it. The stale, burned bun breaks (picture). I successfully scrape the cheese product off the top only to find there's another slice of fake cheese underneath the patty as well.

I was not aware that this particular Mc Donald's was not a corporate store, honestly I wouldn't know how to differentiate one from the other. In any case to my understanding every Mc Donald's ran the same policy in regards to the food they sell, obviously. So when I go to get my coffee, everyone knows you are entitled for one free refill but to my surprise this Mc Donald's does not honor that. The person at the register who's name is Estella (mexican woman) was the one who took my order and made me feel real uncomfortable and awkward when I asked politely for my refill. There were others on line waiting to take their order and I feel like she deliberately embarrassed me. There was no need to make me feel degraded, at the end of the day I am a customer and I have no need to bring my business here. I should of took my business where I noramlly go which is the one located on Washington Ave, in Belleville.

By the time I paid, at 10:02 pm, it was 10:20 pm and I was still waiting on anyone to come to the 3rd window. Then a female employee brought me a kid's meals and when I asked her for the rest of the order, she waved her hand and said "I don't know" with an attitude. She left and I waited 5 more mins before anyone came to the window. A male manager came and I explained what was missing plus to look at the happy meal that only had 4 fries, cold nuggets, no toy, no sauce, no napkins. When I showed the kid's meal, he said what happened to the fries? (as if we ate them). I looked at him and said "that's what you guys gave me and to look at the camera". He then said "hold on" and slammed the window. Another 5 mins go by, gave me the food and I asked where is the sauce and he said the 1st bag, but it wasn't there. As he was getting me the sauce, I told him this was the worst service ever and that I was going to put a review. He shrugged his shoulders, slammed the window and left. I then proceeded to hunk my horn very loudly to see if he came back to the window, but he never did.

I recently went to this Mcdonalds and order 2 quarter pounders with cheese with no ketchup or tomatoes because I have an allergy and a large coke. When I got to work I'm happy that I checked it before I bite into it because it had both. When I called them and spoke to the manager I was asked my name and to come back and they would replace it. I couldn't make it back that day because I was at work so I called the next day and left them know my name and I was going to go by and get the replacement and they said that I was ok to pick it up. Not even 5 minutes later the manager called me back and told me that I couldn't go pick it back up. When I said the manager said it was OK the person that called me back said it was a different manager that I talked to and thistles manager said absolutely not. Which it was the same manager.

The food and service was adequate although the bathroom could have been a a little cleaner.

27876,This McDonald's usually ROCKS!
They can get thru a line that goes all the way to the highway in under 20 min.

Tonight,  there was no line. Also the inside was closed. AND...  THE ICE CREAM MACHINE WAS BROKEN/SHUT OFF. SHOCKER.

My son did something amazing at school and wanted a Sunday for a treat. So thats why we went.

Then they didn't put all the things we ordered in the bag and we drove off. 2 u turns in traffic and waiting in line now to get what they forgot.
So... I asked the manager if they could just add a small bag of fries since we had to do 2 uturns to get this item they forgot to put in the bag. She said No, we can't do that.
REALLY!?!?!?! I have worked in the food industry for 28 years.  I am well aware of what you can and can not do.
You didn't WANT TO. You didn't want to value me as a person, a customer,  or a future. You didn't want to do your job properly in the 1st place. You didn't want to apologize in any way shape or form.

I don't mind that a mistake was made. I do mind that they acted like it was my fault for ordering anything to begin with.

27956,I want to apologize to anyone that I recommended this particular McDonald's to in the past.
This was the restaurant that I used to recommend to tourists when they were looking for a fast place to eat that was away from the Disney parks, but still close enough to get back to the parks quickly. At that time, it was worth it. The menu was cheap (or at least what you know to expect from a international chain) and, since it's a chain, you know what the food is gong to be like.
So, let's look at what you need to do if you are a member of a chain of restaurants. You need to set yourself apart with your service. This WAS the reason I used to recommend this restaurant. Sadly, I don't think they care anymore. The last time we went, half of the kiosks weren't working. One of the three that was, didn't print receipts. (This plays a part into why the service was so atrocious. Actually there was a lot that played into it.) Now, if you've gone to McDonald's at all recently, you know you pick your food at the kiosk, get a number that you take to your table, pay at the kiosk, sit down and wait for your food. Typically all of that takes about five minutes. Well, this day (and what I've garnered from tourists and locals, on many other days) the team at work decided they weren't going to bring the food to the table. That would have been fine if there was any indication ANYWHERE, but of course that would have been a form of service so that didn't happen. After about 15 minutes of trying to find a place where we could all sit together (only a slight exaggeration) we were told by other customers that were leaving that they weren't calling numbers and you had to wait at the counters.
Ok... So I go up to the counter and wait. We get our food 40 minutes later, and there were the obligatory mess ups that we had to get corrected. No big deal, we are used to this.
My in-laws are visiting and at this point I'm trying to figure why they haven't received their order. It dawned on me  that my father in-law doesn't have a receipt (remember the machine that wasn't printing receipts?).
The person calling numbers is calling the number on the receipt, not the tent number. Apparently, my in-laws food was ready in a master of minutes (amazing since that is all customized) and placed in the "abandoned order" area. If we hadn't said anything, they would never have received their food. The lady never once called a tent number. We told another person of the lack of receipt problem. That information never got transmitted to the person calling the numbers. When we spoke with her and told her their was no receipt, she asked us what the receipt number was. We had the tent card in hand and pointed at the receipt plastered on the ice cream machine, and she asked again for the receipt.
Aside from the travesty that was the most important thing a restaurant is to do, the place looked like a slightly cleaned up version of a break room at a local dump. I'm not sure if they just didn't staff well on this shift, but like I said, I've talked to a few tourists and locals and they all say it had been this way a while.,1,2,28.3335081,-81.5137384,Kissimmee,United States,28.3335081 -81.5137384,tb_burgerking,2024-09-10 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

27986,Just stopped by my local McDonald's to pick up some breakfast items before going to work. The 78th Street Tampa Florida branch is always on their mark, quick efficient usually correct with my order of hot tasty food. I can't believe how much I've been eating at McDonald's the last 3 years after many many years of barely ever going there since I was a teenager in the 1970s. Food is definitely better than it used to be, and I love getting deals with their online phone app and food questionnaires for freebies from the receipts.,4,2,28.3335081,-81.5137384,Kissimmee,United States,28.3335081 -81.5137384,tb_burgerking,2024-08-17 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

27995,This McDonald's was excellent,  the staff was courteous and professional and although all I ordered was coffee, it was delicious just as I have come to expect from most of the McDonald's I have been to.

It is comforting to be able to expect consistency from a restaurant,  no matter where I go in America,  so far, there is a better than 90% chance that the coffee, for example,  will be the same thing I am use to and desire.,5,2,28.3335081,-81.5137384,Kissimmee,United States,28.3335081 -81.5137384,tb_burgerking,2024-11-17 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885
28000,They had a broken latte machine.  The kiosk already had our CC deposit.  It took very long to receive our CC refund because the manager had to perform the business, and the restaurant was overly crowded.

Only pro here was that I got what I actually ordered however what a game trying to order it.
The lady was not listening at all and just started adding anything and everything to my order.
She was ruder then my explicit Eminem album and when I finally got to sorting out my order it was awful.. My chicken nuggets tasted like chewing on the chickens feet fresh out of the pen.
My Apple pie was questionable to if it was even a pie or not.
They only gave me bbq sauces, like who doesn't want ketchup ???

28682,This McDonalds location never staffs an employee at the register to take customers' orders.  This results in all customers having to wait until one of the kitchen staff happens to notice the customers standing at the counter, wishing to place their orders.  The expressions on the faces of the kitchen staff makes it clear that they are irritated at having to interrupt their own work to go over and take customer orders.  This situation has not been corrected for over 6 months, resulting in annoying wait times at what is supposed to be a fast food restaurant.

28685,I was light headed. I figured let me stop at this McDonald's seeing that its on my way home and close by. I was surprised the shake machine was up and running. I ordered large fries and a Strawberry milkshake. I paid to much money for a little nit of food. My fries had way too much salt on them. Because they mixed fresh fries with fries that wrre sitting out basically old kinda stale. The milkshake had vanilla at the bottom with Strawberry on top. But that nits what kinda upset me it was the size of the shake. I was asked what size I wanted. Of course I was confused. I guess all McDonald's are not the same. I said small. But the cup I received was a cup size you order off the dollar menu. And I was charged like 5 bucks for it. Smh. Never again. I thought shake size was only small or large.

28724,I never ever go here because it's the most incompetent McDonald's I've ever seen operate. I ran the drive thru in NYC when I was 17 so I know a thing or two about the process and how it's really not rocket science but somehow they can't ever get it right. Unfortunately for me my husband picked up dinner for me from there and I very Unfortunately didn't specify which one to go to... although this one is closest to home I will drive all the way to Altamonte to avoid it, and the way gas prices are that should tell you all you all need to know. Tonight it was missing fries (we ordered a total of 6 whole items so I can see how that was overwhelming to this bunch) and freezing cold fries which I have no idea how you can even do since even if it been under the warmer for a while... stone cold fries? I wouldn't put it past them they kept them on a counter somewhere instead though. And on top of that I made the mistake of asking for extra pickles on my big mac which I'm sure put this kitchen in a frenzy so they just threw all the ingredients in the box so I can do my own assembling of it... which was probably for the best because who knows what chaos it would cause for them to assemble it. I would be embarrassed to own this place. Don't go here... I know it's fast food and we shouldn't expect much but Altamonte Mcds never dissapoints.

28804,I've been going to this location most of my life since it's not far from my home. So I've seen this McDonald's go through a lot of changes. The employees here generally have decent attitudes, there are a few that tend to be rude. The store is also dirty a lot of the time. It's a very busy location, and maybe it's from having a lot of foot traffic, but the floor is usually dirty, the drink station will be filthy and wet and sticky, the ketchup area will be out of ketchup, and/or there will be ketchup all over the place, too. The tables tend to be dirty, too, you usually have to clean off your own table. Also they have those light up tables that kids like, and when I go in there with my kid there will be homeless people sitting there, and they won't be eating, and they'll have their stuff all over the place and sit there for hours. And mind you, these tables seat about 8 and there will be one homeless person sitting there. My kid will want to sit there so he can play with the lights, and I'll have to tell him he can't because this one homeless person sitting at one of the largest table, is camping there. The employees don't seem to care at all that these people are doing this despite them sitting there for hours, but buying anything. Sometimes they'll even be sleeping at the table.
The kid's play area is also really crappy. They have nothing for the kids to play on like a playplace. They have 4 of these really crappy touch screen games things that rarely work properly, or at all. When I was a kid they had a huge playplace, which they took out when they remodeled the store. It even had N64's at one point, along with the playplace. But they took it all out and replaced it with a "sitting" place instead of a playplace. It's really awful.
So, all in all, this McDonald's is dirty, has a lot of homeless people that practically live there, and isn't really kid friendly. The food is okay, as long as it's hot food (I get a lot of cold food or my order is wrong), and the employees are generally friendly, but there have been a lot of times where the managers are rather lackluster, meaning that you can tell they don't want to be there. This location needs a lot of work. And they need to do something about the amount of homeless people that hang around in there. There hasn't been a single time I've gone there that there wasn't at least one homeless person there taking up the interactive table that kids want to sit at, with all their dirty things sitting on the table itself. The table is by the front counter, too and you can often times smell the homeless person that's sitting there the whole time you're waiting in line and waiting for your food and while you get your drinks. It is not kid friendly at all at this store. With the store being in a nicer part of town you'd expect quite a bit more cleanliness.,2,2,28.6553497,-81.3426916,Fern Park,United States,28.6553497 -81.3426916,tb_burgerking,2025-05-05 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

28813,Two employees preparing the food simply didn't wear a mask. I am highly dissatisfied with the effort put into enforcing the wearing of a mask. Why during this pandemic, which has not settled in the least, have you not have had a keen eye on employees in order to safeguard the wellbeing of your customers. It's unacceptable to have this lack of care while thousands of healthcare workers are having to work day in and out (With a mask on!) To save lives. Consider this message before you enter this McDonald's (Or any restaurant really) because the meal you get can very well be the deciding factor on whether or not you live in weeks time.

29816,For the size of the building and play facilities in this McDonald's it's the biggest and the best. If you're looking for customer service not a chance.

29822,Visited the 'world's biggest McDonald's on international drive. Pizza and burger ordered were great, however, had to wait over an hour for food as it was so busy. Pizza also came first, (table delivery) and advised remainder of the order would be delivered shortly. Had to then ask again after around 15 minutes. Order was quickly brought but believe this would have been forgotten if we had not asked.

29852,Really nice McDonalds but the waiting is horrible, no one is taken the in house orders, only drive thru is being taken care of, I've been standing here for 27 minutes until I got to put in my order, not a word said to me about the wait, only 3 of the 8 desserts have labels. Right next to me a customer brought up a buttermilk crispy chicken that got everything on it except for the chicken. After receiving my order McDonald's employee I was telling waiting customers to use the touch screen, One customer said she didn't know how to use it so she was told by the McDonald's employee to continue to wait.

29855,Arrived at the McDonald's at 10:20PM, and the posted hours said the location was open until 12:00AM. An employee locked the door and barricaded it with a trash bin and didn't let us in until we mobile ordered, although another employee seemed confused by this. Another employee was also telling people that the lobby was closed (again, even though the hours stated that the location would be open until 12AM). Additionally, while this happened, there were at least a dozen people sitting down and eating, and there were empty tables.,1,0,28.4238144,-81.4612421,Orlando,United States,28.4238144 -81.4612421,tb_burgerking,2024-12-03 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

29950,My family and I stopped in here for a quick breakfast on our way home from a mini vacation.

I ordered the oatmeal and a hash brown.

An employee Nlnamed TJ brought our food to our table. I noticed I didn't have the apple chunks and raisins that come with the oatmeal. I let her know she went back and brought me what I needed.

I then noticed the hash brown I ordered wasn't on the tray either.
I let her know and she apologized, then comes back with not one but 2 hash browns, which oddly enough my young child decided after we got our food that she did want a hashbrown now. She comped a free hashbrown.
She was such a pleasant person to deal with.  Her customer service and customer care abilities are 20/10

I over heard he saying to another customer that this location isn't her usual location and she is a General Manager.

She took care of evryone around us, with an amazing attitude and a smile on her face, which is a rare occasion.

I hope she gets the recognition she deserves, and a promotion or raise. She turned a typically frustrating situation and made it a pleasant one. It's funny to think that I we left happy even though our order was messed up.,5,2,28.4238144,-81.4612421,Orlando,United States,28.4238144 -81.4612421,tb_burgerking,2025-02-17 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885
29956,Granted we at a busy time of the evening (SeaWorld was getting ready to close), but the lobby to thus McDonald's was locked even though all the signs clearly indicated they were supposed to be open for lobby hours. The drive-thru was open, but it was exceedingly slow. The service was poor, and the products we ordered were sub-par (even for McDonald's standards, which is saying something). We ended up just throwing some of it away. I typically do not leave negative reviews.

THEN I PROCEEDED TO CALL THE NEXT MORNING AND ASKED TO SPEAK TO A MANAGER, EXPLAINED WHAT HAPPENED TOLD HER ID LIKE THE MANAGER NAME FROM THE NIGHT BEFORE TO REPORT IT TO COORPRATE, SHE THEN TOO HUNG UP IN MY FACE TOO!!!

We got turned away at the drive thru because they stated, "we are short staffed and really busy, we can't take any more orders for 20 minutes" and when I asked if I could wait in the drive thru, they told me no because the drive thru is timed and it would time out. I understand being short staffed and running behind on orders, thats understandable, but telling people you're not taking orders for the next 20 minutes..

30066,I waited 20 minutes until I got my food but the order was completely wrong. I ordered two double cheeseburgers and I got one with two patties and a glob of ketchup on it. The other just had a party with two dry pieces of bread on it. The fries were colder than a dead body in a freezer. What an absolute joke of a kitchen staff. Just a bunch of high school dropouts that cant even make a sandwhich correctly.

30092,Waited almost 30 minutes to get my food, while people with bigger orders that came after me, got their food. When asked what was taking so long, they said they are working on the order, then followed by asking me what my order was. After wards, had another employee who knew what was going on come out to ask me again what order was, had to stand there and watch them put my food into a microwave.

30106,One of the worse McDonalds I have ever been to.  There is no welcomes or thank you.  Service treats you like you are a problem for them, ie: the server placed the food on front of the customer and started to walk off, the customer said what about my drink.  The server rolled her eyes walked away, brought the drink back reached through the screen put the drink down and walked away.  No I am sorry, no have a nice day.  For me it took over 7 minutes to just get a milkshake.

30120,Nothing bad to say here! We grabbed some quick breakfast before heading to the parks. We opted to use the digital checkout to place our order which is pretty cool and gives plenty of options to what you order. It also seems to give you a little more time to order. The place was very clean and modern in design. We didn't interact too much with staff but the little we did, they seemed very nice and helpful. Although not used this time by us, I did notice a cart specifically for sauces, seasonings, etc right behind the counter for quick access when asked.. the location was pretty good despite being off a busy road so that didny pose any issues.

After 20 minutes, asked if I could pay manager when she finally came by  register- she told me I would have to wait very rudley and walked away.

30223,Although McDonald's chain is known for it great customer service and fast delivery, however this outlet is different.
They are usually late in service even they are a very few customers.

This wasn't possible because nobody could pay at the kiosk; they had to get a receipt and pay at the register. I left 20 minutes later and went to Wendy's when the line had barely moved.,2,2,28.4238144,-81.4612421,Orlando,United States,28.4238144 -81.4612421,tb_burgerking,2024-11-30 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

30349,Stopped in here on January 24th 2018 and ordered at the counter, a signature classic grilled signature sriacha chicken sandwich with an artisan bun. Paid for my order and waited. When my order was ready it was handed to me in a bag.I asked for ketchup and proceeded to a table to enjoy my meal. First off tge fries were crispy which I prefer, but they were old and not at all indicative of the worlds best fries. I took out my sandwich took bite and noticed sesame seeds in the box. I Checked my receipt to confirm that my sandwich should gave had the artisan bun, proceeded to the counter  to correct the problem with my order to be told tgey were out of artisan buns. I was pissed and walked off. I finished my meal, went to refill my drink and spoke with a man in yellow shirt and tie behind the counter about how terrible that the one woman knew there were no artisan buns but the order taker at the register knew nothing about it as well as the girl who gave me my food. Someone should have confirmed that the sesame seed bun would meet my approval. And I notified him this kind of service was not indicative pf McDonald's and that I would be callong corporate. The following day I contacted McDonald's corporate who passed on my complaint to the restaurant location. I received a call from Rose who apologized for the problem with the order and asked that I come back and give them the opportunity to make tge meal properly per my request. I stopped in on Friday January 26th and Emma made sure that the meal was prepared to the standards I believe McDonald's is known. The sandwich was flavorful with the artisan roll and the fries were hot and fresh. Thanks so much for taking the initiative to prepare my meal to the high quality McDonald's is known to deliver.,3,2,28.4238144,-81.4612421,Orlando,United States,28.4238144 -81.4612421,tb_burgerking,2024-11-01 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

30373,For a prime, busy, tourist filled location, the processes and procedures at this McDonalds are absolutely terrible.  Many of the self-ordering machines do not work, when you use a normal line with a cashier, it's like the employees have never even been to a McDonald's before as they don't even know the menu items (I ordered traditional chicken nuggets meal, so it wasn't pasta, or some sandwich that only special locations have).  When you order at a kiosk, you can order things they do not have such as a waffle cone ice cream.  Then you wait 15+ minutes to find out they don't have waffle cones and wait for an employee to make a fresh one, which she doesn't know how to do so you end up paying $4+ for a cup of ice cream.  I did get my money back for the ice cream because I couldn't believe it took that long.  Don't bother going here; it's not worth it, unless you want to feel like you're waiting at Disney at a subpar place.,1,0,28.4238144,-81.4612421,Orlando,United States,28.4238144 -81.4612421,tb_burgerking,2024-08-23 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

31165,The App let's you order breakfast and pay ahead, but when you show up and it's 10:03, their system won't let them complete your order.

The location is relatively good, the employees are always friend and fast.

But someone needs to pass along yo the corporate office/app devs and need to either decide to

1) prepare prepaid breakfast orders and have them ready before the 10:00 shut off, or

2) allow them to prepare my prepaid breakfast order 3 minutes after "it's no longer breakfast time"

When we requested this again at her window, she rolled her eyes, huffed, and began changing them out. She also gave me 3 Cokes and 1 diet Coke (for the diabetic in the group).

31257,My wife and I was going to this McDonald's for some morning when they had another crew. But here recently they changed the morning to a new crew(an old man, a young vanity lady at the drive through window that is very rude). This crew need to be removed. They never seemed to know how to work and prepare your order in a timely manner. This facility is also made where you can't just get out of line in the drive through which is very dangerous if a car stalls or a real emergency arrives. We will be skipping visiting the morning crew. Plz. change crew or train them better.,1,0,32.7445961,-96.8122859,Dallas,United States,32.7445961 -96.8122859,tb_burgerking,2024-06-18 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

Today we were there around 7pm and the cashier and the manager were so nice to us and they even talked to my kids and made sure that we got everything we asked for. The only thing I didn't like was that for the happy meals for my kids they got the same toy and it was a girl toy, I have a girl and a boy so my son got a girl toy.

Service was relative quick but the store itself was quite dirty. Play place looked like it hasn't been wiped, and most likely haven't been sanitized. Bathrooms needed fixing and also dirty.

31289,A worker called MY order number so obviously I'm gonna grab it. It didn't even occur to me to look at the tray the only thing I noticed was that I was missing a coffee so I set the tray on the table and on my way back I see the manager yelling at my family about how WE grabbed the wrong order and see at first we tried being cool about it. She said she was taking back the extra food and we said that was fine so then she starts grabbing the food we ordered and says we weren't charged for that, after an interesting conversation we establish that my receipt clearly said I was charged. Ten minutes later they've manned to give two BIG orders but haven't managed to give me a bacon egg mcgriddle. So eventually I get the burger and as the manager hands it to me she's telling a worker she gave us 8 hash browns. I obviously heard her and said "no ma'am, we got 4" this same manager then has the audacity to say we already ate them. At this point I'm pissed. I've been accused of not paying for my part of the food, I'm hungry, I've waited way too long, the manager has an attitude, AND she's a accusing my family of eating 4 hash browns in less than a minute. NEVER eating at this McDonald's again.

32323,I ordered takeout from the McDonald's app. After waiting at least 20 minutes they finally talked to me and asked about my order. I said that I put my order in through the app. They said that because their system was down they could not give me the food that I paid for. I spent ten dollars and wasted a half hour of my life. I have had to complain to corporate, I have had to talk to a manager via email. Nothing has been done, they don't even want to give me a refund they merely offered me a coupon which they never gave me. It has been months since this had happened and there is still no resolution. If I left a McDonald's with ten dollars worth of food they would have me arrested but because I am a customer they are fine with stealing my money and my time. This is a terrible McDonald's and because of this experience I will no longer be going to any McDonald's in the future.,1,2,25.8099996,-80.1890981,Miami,United States,25.8099996 -80.1890981,tb_burgerking,2024-10-20 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885

That's when one of the employees said  quote on quote why yall played  like that . Both incidents ms Taylor whose suppose to be manager could not control her staff , neither could she tell me who was in the drive thru taking my order.  She has no control over that staff !!

21231,Not only am I not a big fan of fast food joints but I'm absolutely opposed to filth in any restaurant.
And filth is what I experienced at this McDonald's.
The staff who waited on us was nice, accommodating, and quick, and the food adequate; but the restaurant itself had empty sugar and creamer packs laying everywhere. Reason being, there as no place to throw them away.
So, I am advising you to avoid this McDonald's!,2,2,36.0902437,-115.1758223,Las Vegas,United States,36.0902437 -115.1758223,tb_burgerking,2024-05-21 00:22:35.064191,2024-05-05 01:06:59.99885
